1
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,598
I know you don't smoke weed.

2
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,016
I know this.

3
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,143
But I'm gonna get you high today.

4
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,937
Because it's Friday.

5
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:22,605
You ain't got no job.

6
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,066
And you ain't got shit to do.

7
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,838
Dang, he at it again.

8
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:32,508
My daddy caught him trying to break
in to my house two days ago.

9
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,011
- And beat him down.
For real?

10
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,681
Mama.
Help.

11
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,434
Ha, you little rat bastards.

12
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,034
Gotta start the day off right, man.

13
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,964
Give me the two-piece special,
lots of hot sauce.

14
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,259
And all the fries you can give me.

15
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,432
Thank you.
Thank you.

16
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:37,508
For most people, Friday's just a day
before the weekend.

17
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:42,013
But after this Friday,
neighborhood will never be the same.

18
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,451
Shit.

19
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,464
- What's up?
- Good morning.

20
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,342
Are you prepared for Jehovah's return?

21
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:24,096
Because if you not,
I have a pamphlet here that...

22
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,017
Well, fuck you.

23
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,980
Half-dead motherfucker.

24
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,649
Come on, sister.

25
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,858
Come on, sister.

26
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,238
Dana.

27
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,033
Dana.

28
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,952
- What?
- Do me a favor.

29
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,286
What, Craig?

30
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,996
Hook me up with Debbie.

31
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,457
No.

32
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,960
- Why not?
- Because she about to graduate.

33
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,212
She ain't got no time
to be messing with you.

34
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,214
Come on, Dana.

35
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,507
No.

36
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,968
Plus, Joi will kick your ass anyway.

37
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,470
Joi ain't gonna do a goddamn thing.

38
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,389
Craig, get out of my room.

39
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,265
Shut up.

40
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,895
You need to be up anyway.

41
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,147
- What time is it?
- 12:30.

42
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,817
For real?
Damn!

43
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,321
Yeah.

44
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,842
I got you.

45
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,051
I got you, baby.

46
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,432
All right.

47
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,528
Damn.

48
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,743
Ain't nothing in this house.

49
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,703
Shit.

50
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:20,463
Every time I come in the kitchen,
you in the kitchen...

51
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,633
...in the goddamn refrigerator...

52
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,677
...eating up all the food.

53
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,387
All the chicken.

54
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,972
All the pig feet.

55
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,475
You ate my dinner.
My mashed potatoes.

56
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,853
And the good old gravy I like,
the biscuits I like to sop that gravy.

57
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,104
You ate all that up.

58
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,982
You drink up the milk,
don't care what kind of milk it is.

59
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,443
You don't care, 2 percent,
3 percent, buttermilk.

60
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,988
Patent milk, pull the cow on
a patent milk can, I bet you eat that too.

61
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,325
What's wrong with you?
All I have is my grapes.

62
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,452
You gonna eat up all my grapes.

63
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,538
- Man...
- Now, when I went to bed last night...

64
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,583
...didn't I tell you to take out the trash?

65
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,876
Yeah.

66
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,544
So why didn't you do it?

67
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,922
- I fell asleep.
- I wish you was sleeping now.

68
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,049
I'd knock your head with a left hook...

69
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,135
...make your ass wake you up
and take out that damn trash.

70
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,681
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

71
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,184
I'm throwing this away.
We ain't even got no milk.

72
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,021
You better eat that damn cereal.
You ain't got no damn milk, goddamn bitch.

73
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:23,651
When I was coming up, we didn't have
milk, cereal, a bowl to eat in.

74
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,860
Spoon, fork and knife.

75
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,737
No napkins or nothing.

76
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,073
You do like this.
And put your hands like this.

77
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,950
- You ever do that?
- No.

78
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,285
Have you ever had government cheese?

79
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,538
- Craig, government cheese, you had some?
- No.

80
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:39,041
Big stinking government cheese.
Couldn't take a dump for two weeks.

81
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:44,046
Eat it on the 4th, by the 18th,
everybody trying to get to the bathrooms.

82
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,383
I wanna eat some of them chitlins,
I love pig feet.

83
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,845
The barbecue pig feet were gone.
You got grease all over your mouth.

84
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,972
I had a sweet potato pie,
you ate the pie.

85
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,892
Left me that little plastic thing there.
You ain't got no damn milk.

86
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,769
Ain't that a bitch?
You funny.

87
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,772
You're my boy.

88
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,732
You remind me of my granddaddy.

89
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,735
You know what your problem is?

90
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,321
You think money grows on trees.

91
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,701
Just go out, pick you 4 or $500 and go off
and just dance and eat chicken and dance.

92
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,245
You just having all the fun
in the world.

93
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,664
You know how many stinking dogs
I gotta catch...

94
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,584
...to fill that big ass bowl
you got there, boy?

95
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,627
Forty-five, 50 dogs.

96
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:27,506
Stinking, nasty dogs and 12 of them little
stinking things they call a chihuahua.

97
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,342
You better put some water
on that shit, boy.

98
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,636
All right, I'll eat it.

99
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,139
Hey, hey, hey.

100
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,933
Take the garbage out front, son.

101
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,440
What is wrong with him?

102
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:49,153
Hurry up with the garbage.
I got some more work for you.

103
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,408
What's up, Craig?

104
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,618
Don't "what's up" me.

105
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,121
I need to whoop your little ass
for knocking over these trash cans.

106
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,789
Don't knock these over.

107
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,626
Man, ain't nobody gonna knock over
your stupid trash cans.

108
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,629
You bet not.
Get that little bad ass in school anyway.

109
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,797
- Man, shut up, punk.
- What?

110
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,842
- I'm gonna knock over your trash cans.
- Better run.

111
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,886
Little bastard.

112
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,018
- Hey, Mama.
- Hi, baby.

113
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,729
- How you doing?
- Fine.

114
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:24,980
Oh, what you cooking?

115
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:30,778
I'm making some eggs, bacon, sausage,
pancakes, and some leftover pork chops.

116
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,447
Yeah.
Cook it up.

117
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,449
Mama, you got some glue?

118
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,244
- For what?
- My track slipped out.

119
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,496
- Go look in my dresser.
- You need a wig.

120
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,998
You need a job.

121
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,500
Hook.

122
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:54,510
Mom, you didn't tell Daddy
what happened yesterday, did you?

123
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,013
You know I wouldn't tell on my baby.

124
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,265
Cool.

125
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,891
Craig!

126
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,518
Huh?

127
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,478
Come in here.

128
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,276
Where you at?

129
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,611
In the bathroom.

130
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,867
I'll wait till you come out.

131
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,370
Bring your ass in here.
What you talking about?

132
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:25,833
I smelled your shit for 22 years,
now you can't smell mine for five minutes.

133
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,044
Shut the door.

134
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,386
Your mama told me
what happened to you yesterday.

135
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,431
- What?
- That was stupid.

136
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,685
How the hell you go get fired
on your day off?

137
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:45,894
I don't know.

138
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,065
Well, you need a trade.

139
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:54,278
Take a look at that paper over there
on the counter there.

140
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,245
I ain't trying to be no dog catcher.

141
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,997
Why not?

142
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,749
George Clinton was a dog catcher.

143
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,585
- No, he wasn't.
- Sure he was. That's why he said:

144
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,920
Do the dog catcher, dog catcher

145
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,172
I don't even like dogs.

146
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,506
That's the beauty of it.

147
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,925
I grab a dog...

148
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,137
...and I choke him,
and I kick the shit out of him...

149
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,556
...and I...
All day long, my foot up a dog's ass.

150
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,725
Just bang, bang, bang up his ass.

151
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,518
That's my pleasure.

152
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,520
I don't think so.

153
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,272
I'll tell you one thing.

154
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,609
Around here,
you gonna work or go to school.

155
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,736
The first of the month, rent is due.

156
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,406
If you ain't got nothing on the table,
you don't worry about catching a dog.

157
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,576
You gotta worry about a dog
catching your ass.

158
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,126
What's up?

159
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,795
Nothing.

160
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,839
Where's Debbie at?

161
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,426
Oh, she's at the house.

162
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,304
Craig, can I use y'all's microwave
right quick?

163
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,473
Yeah, what'd you gotta cook?

164
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,308
Some chicken.

165
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,310
- Give it here, I'll do it.
- No.

166
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:12,398
See, I was hoping that I could take it
to the house with me.

167
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,818
My microwave?

168
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,653
Yeah.

169
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,072
That's like me asking
to use your air condition.

170
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,990
You know,
if we had a air conditioner...

171
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,410
...I would let you use...

172
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,953
Craig.
- Damn.

173
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,163
Telephone.

174
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,087
- Hello.
- Who you go to the show with last night?

175
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,964
I didn't go to the show last night.

176
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,507
You ain't got to lie.

177
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,634
Craig, you ain't got to lie.

178
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,010
Ain't nobody lying.

179
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,345
I didn't go to the show.

180
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,390
Yes, you did. Because my sister-in-law's
baby cousin, Traci...

181
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:51,103
...she went to the show last night, she saw
you there all hugged up with some tramp.

182
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,856
Now tell me who she was.

183
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,608
Your sister-in-law's baby cousin, Traci,
is a goddamn...

184
00:12:58,862 --> 00:12:59,945
Yeah, she a liar.

185
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,823
She ain't seen me at no movies
hugged up with nobody.

186
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,825
Yeah, yeah.
Well, let me tell you what.

187
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:10,122
You just tell the bitch, whoever she is,
when I catch her, I'm gonna beat her ass.

188
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,502
That girl gone.

189
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,715
I don't know why you messing
with that little fast-assed girl anyway.

190
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:23,010
Now that other girl, Debbie?
She's cute.

191
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,512
She's in school.
She has all her teeth.

192
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,764
I don't know what her sister's doing.

193
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,726
I'm trying to get with her,
but Dana won't even hook me up.

194
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,061
I told you to hook yourself up.

195
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,732
You need to hook up them clippers
and get the back of that neck.

196
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,318
Don't even talk
with all the horses missing their hair here.

197
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,570
- Oh. Here you go.
Hey, it's too early.

198
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,572
Hey, it's too early.

199
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,867
Now, Craig,
you know what your problem is?

200
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,745
You have no game.

201
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,501
What you know about game?

202
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,586
I got all the game.

203
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,087
Now, your father?

204
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,714
He got game.

205
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:09,431
Don't nobody go in the bathroom
for about 35, 45 minutes.

206
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,724
Somebody open a window.

207
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,061
You call that game?

208
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,272
There go my ride.

209
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,441
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye-bye, honey.

210
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,734
- I gotta go.
- Bye, Daddy.

211
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,444
Bye-bye, baby.

212
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,446
Bye-bye, baby.

213
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,034
Craig, you listen to me.

214
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:35,374
I want you to get your ass up today,
go out and look for a job.

215
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,960
The word today is job.

216
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,629
J-O-B.

217
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,297
- You hear me?
Yeah.

218
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,800
You go look for a job today.

219
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,635
I'm not kidding.

220
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,138
Open all the windows.
Damn, it stinks in here.

221
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,312
Where mine at?

222
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,941
Oh, I didn't say I was cooking nothing for you.
This is for me.

223
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,611
Have some cereal.

224
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,113
We ain't got no milk.

225
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,657
Use water.
It won't hurt.

226
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,617
Oh, man.

227
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,413
- Huh?
- Nothing.

228
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,710
Break yourself, fool.

229
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,337
Look what you did to my curtain.

230
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,091
Better watch who window you climbing in
before you get blasted on.

231
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,343
With what?
You ain't got nothing, man.

232
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,012
With this.

233
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,972
- Where you get that from?
- Your mama.

234
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,600
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

235
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,935
Come on outside, man, stop playing.

236
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,186
Heh, heh, heh.

237
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,439
Gotta get dressed.

238
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,025
Hurry up.
- Don't tell me to hurry up.

239
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,614
Damn.

240
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,460
What's up, Big Worm?

241
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,045
How much you got left?

242
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,716
- Man, I got a lot.
- You still ain't sold that weed, Smokey?

243
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,093
Man, I'm trying to, Worm.

244
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,054
Niggers are broke these days.

245
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,806
I don't think you applying yourself,
Smokey.

246
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,308
Huh?

247
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,396
- You smoking my shit?
- Hell, no. Fuck with your shit? Hell, no.

248
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,358
- You smoking my shit?
- Why would I do some shit like that?

249
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,402
I don't wanna have to fuck you up,
Smokey.

250
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,906
Playing with my money
is like playing with my emotions.

251
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,574
Worm.

252
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,702
Hey, you the last brother money
I'd mess with.

253
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,997
I'll steal from my mama
before I mess with your shit.

254
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,375
And you know this, man.

255
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,251
We'll see.

256
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,382
Old Florida Evans-looking motherfucker.

257
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,889
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

258
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,224
Why you ain't at work?

259
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,101
I got fired yesterday.

260
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,019
For real?

261
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,480
I thought you had the day off yesterday.

262
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,400
I did.
I went in there to pick up my check.

263
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,734
Came home.

264
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,820
Supervisor called me about 4:00.

265
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,490
Talking about they got me on video tape
stealing boxes.

266
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,118
What the fuck you doing
stealing boxes for?

267
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,203
What, you trying to build a clubhouse?

268
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,997
- Man, I know you ain't go out like that.
- Hell, no.

269
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,125
They ain't got me on tape.

270
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,793
She said they did.

271
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,878
Fired me on the spot.

272
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,714
Talking about pressing charges.

273
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:34,469
Goddamn, you got to be a stupid
motherfucker to get fired on your day off.

274
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,891
- Pops talking about kicking you out again?
- Yup.

275
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,645
Oh, goddamn.

276
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,480
Man, look.

277
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,659
Hi, you guys.

278
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,786
Heey.

279
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:04,332
Ooh.
Man, man, man.

280
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,960
Her mama got ass too.

281
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,797
Just give me three and a half minutes,
maybe even four...

282
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,592
...she'll be wanting to marry a nigger.

283
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,927
- Who, her mama?
- Yeah.

284
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,680
Older the berry, the sweeter the juice.

285
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,349
It's the blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice.

286
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,644
Yeah, well, yeah.
She blacker than a motherfucker too.

287
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,522
I ain't fucking with you.
Watch out.

288
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,693
She wanted to give me the ass
one time, I had to go to work and shit.

289
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,070
I wonder where she going.

290
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,407
She probably going to that new health club
down on 108th.

291
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,993
- Oh, so they opened that already?
-Yep.

292
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,411
I heard they hiring too.

293
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:45,415
You need to go down there and see
what's up, with your out-of-work ass.

294
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,590
Hey, hold up.
My mom's in there.

295
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,760
She about to go to work though.

296
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,178
Hey.

297
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,263
I know you don't smoke weed.

298
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,723
I know this.

299
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,809
But I'm gonna get you high today.

300
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,644
Because it's Friday.

301
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,312
You ain't got no job.

302
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,815
And you ain't got shit to do.

303
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,026
Anyway, what you doing up so early?

304
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,196
Oh, man, I tried to come and catch you
before you went to work...

305
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,240
...let you know
what happened to Red's ass.

306
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,449
What's up?

307
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:23,203
Man, you know that nigger Deebo
done had his bike for three weeks, right?

308
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,579
- Right.
- Man....

309
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,916
I got so much money,
I got another nigger just to count it for me.

310
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,793
I won.
Give me my money.

311
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,712
- You what?
- I lost.

312
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,384
Roll the dice.

313
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,595
Deebo.

314
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,098
Hold my money.

315
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,935
- Watch him.
Can I talk to you for a second?

316
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,688
Oh, shit.

317
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,499
Pop's tripping, man.
He want me to ask for my bike back.

318
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,126
You know I wouldn't trip.

319
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,211
- What bike?
- The beach cruiser.

320
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,798
The one I let you use a couple of weeks ago.
The one I been asking you about.

321
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,801
Oh.
That bike.

322
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,388
I didn't know you wanted it back, homey.
It's right here.

323
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,098
Follow me, homey.

324
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,934
It's just like it's both ours.

325
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,978
- We just keep it down at my house.
- Cool.

326
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,651
Oh, shit!
- Oh.

327
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,489
That's my bike, punk!

328
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,325
Goddamn.

329
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,496
You got knocked the fuck out.

330
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:57,172
- You want some of this too, old man, huh?
- No.

331
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,174
Get off your ass and get in this car.

332
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:02,928
Boy, I don't know why you come down here
messing with these people.

333
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,429
Hurry up.

334
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,518
Man, they both got in the car
and boned out.

335
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,354
- You lying.
- I swear to God.

336
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,940
- We was rolling.
- Damn.

337
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,109
Craig, tell that little girl
to stop playing on my phone.

338
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,862
- What little girl?
- Joi. She keeps calling, hanging up.

339
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,199
And I know it's her because I star-69'd her.
She hung up again.

340
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,368
I don't like her disrespecting my house.

341
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:30,288
- Now, you tell her I said to stop it, all right?
- Okay.

342
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,332
Hi, Mrs. Jones.

343
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,417
Hi, Smokey!

344
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,880
Damn.

345
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,007
What time your mama leaving?

346
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,968
In a little while.
Why?

347
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,387
Because I wanna smoke this joint.

348
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,597
Let's go to my house real quick.

349
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,058
Can't do shit over here.

350
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,811
- Damn, Lil Chris got you too?
- Hell, yeah.

351
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,813
Got me too, little bitch-ass nigger.

352
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,983
If I catch him,
I'm gonna beat him like I was his dad.

353
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,777
Excuse me?
What?

354
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,405
Could y'all stay off my grass, please?

355
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,990
Thank you.

356
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,201
Stanley be acting like a old bitch.
I know.

357
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,911
Nothing but dirt any damn way.

358
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,121
Remember this?

359
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,664
- Hey, man.

360
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,499
Shut up.

361
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,044
Damn.

362
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,756
Mama.

363
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,135
Mama.

364
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,056
Damn, Smoke. What you doing
knocking like you the damn police?

365
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,766
I'm in here on the phone.

366
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,935
I left my key.

367
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:38,356
Always talking shit.
Just can't open the goddamn door.

368
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,111
Stop slamming my goddamn door.

369
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,114
- Sorry, Joann.

370
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,125
Come in here.
You don't wanna hear that shit.

371
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,798
- Ha, ha, ha. Yes, I did.
- Get your ass up and cook...

372
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,425
...or clean up or do something.

373
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,140
Always talking shit.

374
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,735
Damn.

375
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,237
All you do is smoke weed.

376
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,788
That's all right.

377
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,373
Don't worry about what fuck
I be doing.

378
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,382
What I'm tripping on...

379
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,259
...is how you gonna sell bud...

380
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,720
...and you smoking it?

381
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,680
I don't know.

382
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,184
- That's my only problem.
- Big Worm gonna end up fucking you up.

383
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,020
Big Worm ain't gonna do
a goddamn thing, man.

384
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,189
All right.

385
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,983
Look, he need me.

386
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,946
Red told me he smoked a fool
for 50 bucks.

387
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,156
I don't give a fuck.

388
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,326
Smokey, I need you to go to the store
and get me some cigarettes.

389
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,203
Give me the money.

390
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,082
Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute.
What's this?

391
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,458
This ain't enough.

392
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,378
Make it enough.

393
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,381
Damn.

394
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,071
Oh, yeah.

395
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,615
Smokey.

396
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,367
Smokey.

397
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,244
Smokey.

398
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,832
Smokey. Smokey.
Smokey, wait.

399
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,625
Hey, let me wash your car for $2.

400
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,127
Hell, no, you'll smoke it up.

401
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,379
No, man.
Smoke, no. I don't smoke no more.

402
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:09,340
- Get off me.
- Buy me a 40 ounce for my birthday.

403
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,550
Today your birthday?

404
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,135
What's today?

405
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,430
- Man, come on.
- All right.

406
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,606
- Oh, I'm shot.
Get your ass off me.

407
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,113
I need some papers...

408
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,907
...and some humps.

409
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,325
Hey.

410
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,534
Get these for me.

411
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:40,121
I ain't got no money. Not enough.
- You owe me two dollars.

412
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,248
Add these.

413
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,251
Aah! Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I'm hurt.

414
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,796
Yah! Oh, I fall.
I'm suing y'all.

415
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,924
I'm hurt.
Oh, my neck.

416
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,427
My back.
My neck and my back. Oh.

417
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:57,722
I want 150,000.

418
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,891
We can settle out of court now
for 20 bucks.

419
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,562
Man, get your punk ass up.
It ain't even wet over here. Damn.

420
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,315
Look here, give me 10 dollars,
and I won't say nothing.

421
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,484
- Get out. Get out.
- 2.50 and a jawbreaker?

422
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,653
- Dollar and some envelopes.
What you doing?

423
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,364
You know how much money you can get
for a slip and fall?

424
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,491
- You need to stay off that crack.
- Get out.

425
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,076
You wrong, brother.
You wrong.

426
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,994
- You wrong. He wrong.
Get out.

427
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,372
Brother, stay black.

428
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,165
He was... I don't like that.

429
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,334
Hell, no.
Watch out.

430
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,213
Hey, thanks, Smoke.

431
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:33,132
Thanks, my ass.
You better come by my house, wash my car.

432
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,509
- Be there.
- I'm serious.

433
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,135
All right.

434
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,033
Goddamn.

435
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,831
- Goddamn.
Stop your shit.

436
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,874
Stop the mother...

437
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,836
Dizam.

438
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,213
Fuck.
Fuck.

439
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:14,549
Watch my car,
make sure nobody mess with it.

440
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,400
Damn.

441
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,028
Mrs. Parker finer than a motherfucker.

442
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:39,198
Damn.
I'd knock the dust off that pussy.

443
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,036
Damn.

444
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,915
Hi, Mrs. Parker.

445
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,001
Hi, boys.

446
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,920
When you going to let me fuck,
Mrs. Parker?

447
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,589
What'd you say, honey?

448
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,342
Huh?
Nothing.

449
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,391
Mrs. Parker just don't know.

450
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,018
Needs some young meat.

451
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,145
Mr. Parker ain't hitting that right, man.

452
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,065
She know what she's doing
with them little ass shorts on.

453
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,358
She know we be looking.

454
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,488
Craig, I'm on my way to work.

455
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,782
Make sure if you leave,
you lock up the house.

456
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,534
Answer the phone,
the cable people are supposed to call.

457
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,203
All right.

458
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,331
Look at her.

459
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:31,459
She ought to be ashamed of herself
coming out looking like that.

460
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,252
Hey, girl.

461
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:34,879
Hey, how you doing?

462
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,340
Fine.
I'm on my way to work.

463
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:39,675
Call me when you get home.

464
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,844
Okay.

465
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:54,649
Hey, go in the house
and get me something to roll this up with.

466
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,484
All right.

467
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,034
Hey, and bring a radio too.

468
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,131
Hello?

469
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,512
Holy shit.

470
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:36,149
It's hot as hell out here.

471
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,820
You a hype.

472
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,989
- What?
- You a hype.

473
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,366
Man, ain't nothing wrong
with smoking weed.

474
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,326
Weed is from the earth.

475
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,996
God put this here for me and you.

476
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:51,497
Take advantage, man.

477
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,666
Take advantage.

478
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,590
Hey, fuck, man.

479
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,604
Put that out, man.
Here come the pastor.

480
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:57,939
For what?

481
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,440
He probably smoke bud too.

482
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,025
How you doing, Brother Craig?

483
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,486
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

484
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:04,820
Well, I see.

485
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,531
By any chance is Sister Jones in?

486
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,867
Nope.
Neither is Brother Jones, they both at work.

487
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,119
Where your ass need to be, nigger.

488
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,081
Excuse me, brother.

489
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:19,001
What we call drugs
at 74th Street Baptist Church...

490
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,629
...we call a sinny-sin-sin

491
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,716
Well, around here
Between Normandie and Western

492
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,761
We call this here
A little twenty-twen-twen'

493
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:31,389
- Wow
- Nigger

494
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,182
Give me a little for my cataracts?

495
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,811
- You didn't put in on this, man.
- Better to give than to receive, brother.

496
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,813
Look, look, look.
She bending over.

497
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:40,648
Good Lord, have mercy.

498
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,693
The Lord is my shepherd,
he know what I want. Excuse me.

499
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,653
Mrs. Parker.
Mrs. Parker. Can I talk...

500
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:50,491
I told you, the weed be letting you know
evil lurks.

501
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,796
Look, Hector almost hit his nasty ass.

502
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,506
What's up, Smokey?

503
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,133
Fuck you.

504
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,975
Why you don't like Hector?

505
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:19,186
I was telling you I was smoking weed
with that fool one day.

506
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:24,275
So you decided to smoke
with the big boys, huh, Smokey?

507
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,861
You ain't showing me nothing new, ese.

508
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,367
Shut up and take a hit.

509
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,830
Smoke Dog, baby.

510
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,415
Remember that shit.

511
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,792
Been smoking since I was 2.

512
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,087
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, homes.

513
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,340
I know what I'm doing, man.

514
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,258
Shut the fuck up.

515
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:55,306
Homestead, yo, take it easy, ese.

516
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,185
What's this?

517
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,063
It's angel dust, homes.

518
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,066
So I hit it real hard, right?

519
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,526
As soon as he said that...

520
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,363
...I started feeling funny as hell.

521
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:14,241
Next thing I knew, I was running
down the street in my damn drawers.

522
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,786
Hey, man.
Get off me.

523
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,079
Get off me, man.

524
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,414
Get off me, man.
Goddamn.

525
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,375
Goddamn.
Motherfuckers.

526
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,924
Get off me.
Get off me.

527
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:33,135
I'm in Deebo's pigeon coop
sweating like a slave.

528
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,097
And the only person who could get me out
was my mom.

529
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:40,267
And, man,
I ain't been right ever since then.

530
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,980
That's why I been like, "Fuck Hector."

531
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,650
Yeah, I remember that.

532
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:49,151
Peep.

533
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,613
Damn.

534
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,243
Listen.

535
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,748
Man, that's Lil Chris.

536
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,126
Let's go get his ass.

537
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,298
Quit playing.
Quit playing.

538
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,758
Quit playing.
Quit playing.

539
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,218
Don't let me catch you, boy.

540
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,095
Stop. Stop, man.
Quit playing.

541
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,974
I'm gonna knock them over next week.

542
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,434
Man, y'all some busters.

543
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,894
Y'all can't see me, punks.

544
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,316
Nigger, you slow.

545
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,528
- Run like a girl.
- Fuck you.

546
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,248
Oh, shit.
Here come Deebo.

547
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,000
- Give me your stuff.
- Oh, shit.

548
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:51,130
Known for jacking a nigger.
That's all he do. Damn.

549
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,362
- What's up, Smoke?
- Nothing.

550
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,656
What you got on my drink?

551
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,200
Nothing.

552
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,998
Don't lie.

553
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,666
Got nothing, man.

554
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,710
What you got, Craig?

555
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:30,920
I'm broke as a joke.

556
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,047
Y'all some high rollers and y'all broke.

557
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,052
What's up, Stanley?

558
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,638
Well, fuck you then, punk.

559
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,561
Telling Craig,
Stanley's been acting funny lately.

560
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,647
Stanley left his window open, man.

561
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,482
Come on, Smoke, let's go in.

562
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,234
I'm on probation, I can't be....

563
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,069
Stop being a bitch and come on.

564
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,201
Craig, if somebody comes, whistle.

565
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,828
I ain't trying to get involved.

566
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,372
If you don't get involved,
I'm gonna knock your ass out too.

567
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:08,749
Make a choice.

568
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,175
Man, hurry up.

569
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,886
You a bitch!

570
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,346
Bitch!

571
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,599
For some reason, I don't think
Smokey wanted to go in there...

572
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,686
...but peer pressure's a motherfucker.

573
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,872
Come on, nigger.

574
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,625
Damn.
Always caught in the middle of something.

575
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,295
Dump your ass over the window.

576
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,713
Hurry up, shit.

577
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,298
Hurry up.

578
00:36:58,425 --> 00:36:59,967
- Pick it up.
Hey, hey.

579
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,595
Oh, shit.

580
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,057
It's on now.

581
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,811
- Damn.
Watch my foot.

582
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,646
Hurry up.

583
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,234
Come on, man. Bring your ass out.
Come on.

584
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,904
Get off my ass!

585
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,614
Shit.
Hurry up.

586
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,824
Get off my ass.
I ain't with that funny shit.

587
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:26,744
Hello.

588
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,665
Oh, man.
Come on.

589
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,208
Goddamn.

590
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,588
Just wait till I get my hands on you.

591
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,758
Baby, baby, we was just praying.

592
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,843
We was just praying.

593
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,682
I'll kill him.
- Aah!

594
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,518
- We was just praying.
I'll get you.

595
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,023
Goddamn devil.

596
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,860
He wasn't even that good, baby.

597
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,571
I'll kill you.
Yeah, I know.

598
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,449
Damn.

599
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,759
Come on.

600
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,223
Get your feet down.

601
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,479
Come on, man.
Move it.

602
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,526
- What took y'all so long?
- This fool's scared. He didn't even...

603
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,950
Look, fellas.

604
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,410
I asked you nicely.

605
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,412
Now I'm getting very irritated.

606
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:56,709
For the last time, would you please stay off
my frigging grass, please.

607
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,085
All right, man. Sorry.

608
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,753
Thank you.

609
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,592
Scary ass didn't wanna touch nothing.

610
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,762
- Was in there whole time arguing.
- So y'all didn't get nothing?

611
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,515
Hell, yeah.
We got about 200 dollars, huh, Deebo?

612
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,184
I got about 200 dollars.

613
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,603
Uh....

614
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,611
One day somebody gonna kick his ass.

615
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,283
Man, I've been getting high all week.

616
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,792
Take a puff.

617
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,545
- Take a hit.
- You watch out.

618
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:42,755
Craig.

619
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,549
Ain't like you got shit to do tomorrow.
You don't have to go to work.

620
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:46,967
Now, take a hit.

621
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,469
I drink.

622
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,889
Craig, it'll stimulate your mind.

623
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,433
You ain't got shit to do.

624
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,060
All right.

625
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,146
Put it in your mouth.

626
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,898
Shut up.

627
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,282
That's the shit, ain't it?

628
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,743
That's the shit.

629
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,955
That's the shit.

630
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,048
Wet the motherfucker all up.

631
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,967
It's my shit.
I can do whatever I wanna do.

632
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:37,684
Stop hitting it so hard.

633
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,396
You fucking up the rotation.

634
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,148
Puff, puff, give.

635
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,192
Puff, puff, give.

636
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,529
Fucking up the rotation.
You could get killed with somebody else.

637
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,907
That's some serious shit.
You're lucky you're my boy.

638
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,869
Oh, shit.

639
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,455
Take your time.

640
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,624
Gotta crawl before you walk.

641
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,048
You high yet?

642
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,886
Craig, you fucked up.
You fucked up.

643
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:25,107
You said this was indo.

644
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,401
Smell like outdo.

645
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:28,735
Hey, wait a minute, man.

646
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:32,030
I ain't gonna be supplying you
you gonna be talking about my shit.

647
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,076
Oh, shit.
Here come Felisha.

648
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,203
Oh, shit.

649
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,415
Old begging ass.

650
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,083
I know.

651
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,713
What's up, Craig?

652
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:50,716
- What's up, Smokey?
- Nothing.

653
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,928
What y'all smoking on?

654
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,181
Nothing.
What you want?

655
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,266
Oh.

656
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:00,934
I need to borrow your car quick.

657
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,020
What kind of shit is that?

658
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:06,023
Most people wanna borrow sugar
or even ketchup.

659
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,524
You wanna borrow my car?

660
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,068
Hell, no.

661
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,404
- Get the hell on.
- Let me borrow a joint.

662
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,740
You need to borrow a job,
with your broke ass.

663
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:17,117
Always trying to smoke up
somebody's shit.

664
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,785
Get the hell on, Felisha.

665
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,078
I'll remember that.

666
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,624
Remember it. Write it down.
Take a picture. I don't give a fuck.

667
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,879
Craig?

668
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,881
Bye, Felisha.

669
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,718
Y'all stingy.

670
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,140
Goddamn pest.

671
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,772
Oh, man.

672
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,943
This bud is kicking in.

673
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,737
Don't start tripping, Craig.

674
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:57,950
Smoke.

675
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,454
I ain't tripping.

676
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,291
Craig.

677
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,377
Craig. Craig.

678
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,128
Hold up.

679
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:13,966
I can hear my heart beat.

680
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,842
Man, that what it's supposed to do.

681
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,804
No, my shit beating too fast.

682
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,724
It's the chronic.
Don't even worry about it.

683
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,226
Listen.

684
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,561
You don't hear it?

685
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,313
Hell, no.

686
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:36,029
I knew I shouldn't have given him
no chronic.

687
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:44,037
You hear my phone ring?

688
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,872
Man, hell, no.

689
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,457
Man, sit down.

690
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,460
I'm on house arrest.
I'm not even supposed to be over here.

691
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,297
Get a nigger locked up.
Man, come on.

692
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,091
Come in.
I'm thirsty.

693
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,351
- You be tripping, man. Come on.
- Shut up.

694
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,812
Sit your skinny ass down.

695
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,064
You want some Kool-Aid?

696
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,066
Man, you know I want some Kool-Aid.

697
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,904
You smoking my weed too?

698
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:22,617
I'm gonna kill you and Smokey.
You're playing with my emotions.

699
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,422
Damn.

700
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,632
What?

701
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,551
I ain't got no sugar.

702
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:42,596
You ain't got no sugar?

703
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,723
Damn.

704
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,559
Y'all ain't never got two things
that match.

705
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,770
Either y'all got Kool-Aid, no sugar...

706
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,271
...peanut butter, no jelly...

707
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,774
...ham, no burger.
Damn.

708
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,110
You're a funny looking motherfucker.

709
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,199
Man, hold up.

710
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,951
I don't do that gay shit, now.

711
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,037
You want me
to go get the sugar or what?

712
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,955
Yes.

713
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,291
Yes.

714
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,644
Oh, shit.
It's the motherfucking cops.

715
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,813
They know I'm over here.

716
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:35,649
Shit.
Watch out.

717
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,651
Is it the cops?

718
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,488
Hey, what's up?
Come on in.

719
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,990
Is Dana here?
- Uh....

720
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,786
No. No.
She ain't came home from school.

721
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,621
- You ain't seen her?
- Debbie.

722
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:50,997
- Debbie.
What?

723
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,959
Come here.
Sit down.

724
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,380
Hi, Smokey.

725
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,761
- You had a friend wanna hook up with me.
- I do.

726
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,680
- First, how she look?
- She's nice.

727
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:08,390
She got a big booty?

728
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:11,518
Smokey, I'm not trying to look
at that girl's booty, all right?

729
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,854
You know you done
looked at her booty before.

730
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,522
Just call her, all right?

731
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:18,191
- She at home?
- She should be.

732
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:23,029
Cheap ass phone.

733
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:32,038
Come over here and sit down.
Right here.

734
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,332
You're way over there.

735
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:39,963
Hey, uh, this is Smokey.

736
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,715
Debbie's homeboy.

737
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:43,383
She said you wanted to hook up.

738
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,051
Craig.

739
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,720
What's up?

740
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:49,556
- Are you high?
- Huh?

741
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,391
- Are you high?
- No, why you say that?

742
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:54,144
Because you look
like you've been smoking.

743
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,146
For real?

744
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:59,399
No, I'm cool.

745
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,087
Do I still look high?

746
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,881
Now, describe yourself.

747
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:27,135
I'm about 5'2",
light-skinned, long hair.

748
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,637
I'm thick.

749
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,139
People say I look like Janet Jackson.

750
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:33,642
For real?
No shit?

751
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:34,851
Janet Jackson?

752
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,022
Oh, boy.

753
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,733
You know,
your sister came by here today, begging.

754
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,610
- Who, Felisha?
- Yes.

755
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,779
She is a trip, I know.

756
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:49,533
Why don't you come over.
Come to my homey's house.

757
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,701
All right.
He live on Debbie's street?

758
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,495
Yeah.
You know Dana, right?

759
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:57,165
The other day I had to stop Deebo
from beating her ass.

760
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,375
What?

761
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:01,836
Yes. When he gets high and drunk
he starts tripping.

762
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,129
One time he grabbed me.

763
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,424
- No.
- Yes, grabbed me like this.

764
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:11,137
For real?
I mean, was it like this or was it like this?

765
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,639
Ooh, um...

766
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:15,684
I think it was the first one.

767
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,144
- It was the first? You sure?
- Mm-hm.

768
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:22,983
What the fuck?

769
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,571
Oh, man, I'm tripping.

770
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,824
What's wrong?

771
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,244
Am I tripping?

772
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,912
I, uh...

773
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,497
I got to go in here.

774
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,583
In the back room real quick.

775
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:43,044
- All right. All right.
Bye.

776
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,462
Bye.

777
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,095
I ain't getting high no more.

778
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,724
Ain't getting high no more.

779
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,350
Shit.

780
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,273
- So, what's up? Did you guys hook up?
- It's cool.

781
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,525
- All right, well, I'm about to go home.

782
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:08,028
You know,
my homey wanna hook up with you.

783
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,529
- Who?
- Craig.

784
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,454
Craig already has a woman.

785
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,581
But he don't like her.

786
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,751
I'll see you later.

787
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,715
Why you tell her I wanna hook up?

788
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,675
She don't be believing me.

789
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,469
I'm high.

790
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:38,183
Hey.
What's with you and that chickenhead?

791
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,726
Oh.

792
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:40,935
Man.

793
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,021
She said she looked like Janet Jackson.

794
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:47,400
- You lucky.
- And you know this, man.

795
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:50,820
Oh, man.

796
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,572
- Hey, Dad.
- Oh.

797
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,532
What happened to you?

798
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,409
I got bit in the ass today, son.

799
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,411
By a stinking-ass filthy dog.

800
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:01,706
You should have seen it.
Biggest dog I've ever seen in my life.

801
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,917
I said, "Doggy,
please don't bite me, dog."

802
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:07,587
And I turned around to jump over the fence,
the dog grabbed my ass.

803
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:08,880
I told you.

804
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,091
I told you.

805
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,010
- I told you.
- You didn't tell me shit.

806
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,597
Y'all get on the front porch
with all that damn noise.

807
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:19,599
Was it like, "grawr"?

808
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,435
- How your ass feel Mr. Jones?
- Get out of my house.

809
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:24,938
- Don't slam that door.
- All right, man.

810
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:27,982
Hey. You kids,
quit slamming my goddamn door.

811
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,734
Damn.

812
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,536
Oh, shit.

813
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,793
What you gonna do?

814
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:51,798
Hey, hey, hey.

815
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,552
- What you want?
- What you got?

816
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:58,096
Boy, what the fuck you want?

817
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,056
Give me some chili Fritos.

818
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,562
Come here.

819
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,439
Come here.

820
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,488
What's up, Big Perm?

821
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:16,656
I mean, Big Worm.

822
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,992
- You sell that bud?
- I sold some of it.

823
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,412
Give me the rest. Somebody want
a couple of 20s around the corner.

824
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,789
No, I'm just bullshitting.

825
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:25,999
I sold that shit.

826
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:28,835
- Then count out my money.
- Hurry up.

827
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:31,755
Don't you see we handling
grown folks business?

828
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,007
Damn.
Now, shut the hell up.

829
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,593
20.

830
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,847
40, 60, 80.

831
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,185
A hundred, 120, 140.

832
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,980
Wait, man. That's 100 dollars.
Stop playing with me, Smokey.

833
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:52,942
You know what happened?

834
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,694
You're gonna laugh you're ass off.

835
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,070
You know Craig?

836
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:59,365
- Craig got fired yesterday.
- What the fuck that gotta do with me?

837
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,284
Let me explain.

838
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,453
We was talking
over all our problems, right?

839
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,371
And you know how we do it.

840
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,956
We started getting high.

841
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,958
Nigga, we go fucked up.

842
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,503
Look, nigga, I'm gonna be here
at 10:00 on the dot.

843
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,964
Not 10:03, not 10:36.

844
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:19,385
If you ain't got my money or my bud,
I'm killing you and him.

845
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,225
- You're gonna kill me?
- Get the fuck out of my face.

846
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,854
Back, back.

847
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,816
Can I have my chili Fritos?

848
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,318
You can't have shit.
I'm closed, fat boy.

849
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:38,488
Then give me my money back.
- It's my money.

850
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,281
Mama.

851
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:41,825
I hate him.

852
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,917
- What'd he say?
- Huh?

853
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:52,627
What'd he say?

854
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:55,088
Oh, he just said for us to pay him
by 10:00.

855
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,006
What you mean "us"?

856
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,925
Man, that fool ain't gonna do nothing.

857
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,427
Man, I know you didn't...

858
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,555
- Worm!
- What you doing?

859
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:06,432
- Craig.
- Worm!

860
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,810
Damn.

861
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,478
What's up?

862
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:13,314
- What did you tell him?
- I just told him we was smoking.

863
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:15,567
And we was just chilling.

864
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:17,193
Man, you were smoking.

865
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,779
I smoked half a little piece of joint
with you.

866
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,615
- That fool ain't gonna do nothing.
- What'd he say?

867
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,368
What'd he say?

868
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,124
If we don't pay him by 10:00,
he gonna bust a cap in both our ass.

869
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,918
Nigga, we need to pay, he crazy.
Let's stick together.

870
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:36,546
I can't believe you got me in the mix
with this fool.

871
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,884
I didn't put that joint to your lip,
make you smoke.

872
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,093
Might as well.

873
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:43,761
"Come on, Craig, man."

874
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,513
"Stimulate you mind, man."

875
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,308
"It's Friday."
"We'll get you high."

876
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,685
Why you bringing up old shit?

877
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,103
Craig.

878
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,856
I left my purse in your house.
Can I go in and get it?

879
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:57,275
- Yeah, come on.
- All right.

880
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:23,176
Fool?!

881
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:26,095
- Where Craig at?
- Fool?

882
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,058
Oh, he's in the house.

883
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,450
Hell, no.

884
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,704
Who is that bitch?

885
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,206
Yeah, who's that bitch?

886
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:55,041
Who you talking to?

887
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:58,211
Nigga, I'm talking to you.
Now, who is she?

888
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:00,546
That's just Debbie from down the street.

889
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,383
So?
What the hell's she doing in there?

890
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,927
She was just... Just go in the house.

891
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:09,222
- What you looking at?
- Get your ass in the house.

892
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,057
Hurry up.

893
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:15,144
Look, I'm gonna straighten this girl out.
I'll be right back.

894
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,856
All right, man. I'm gonna go
to the crib, man. My stomach hurt.

895
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,441
Hey.

896
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:23,528
- Come back.
- All right.

897
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:28,992
Watch this.
Whoo!

898
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,830
Mama.

899
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,007
Shit.

900
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:54,809
What the hell you want, boy?
Damn.

901
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:57,562
Mr. Jones,
can I use your bathroom, please?

902
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,941
What you gonna do?
Number one or number two?

903
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,360
- Number two.
- Shit.

904
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,946
You ain't gonna drop
no stinky loads here.

905
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,781
Anybody drop stinky loads, it's me.

906
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:11,242
Mr. Jones.
Mr. Jones.

907
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:27,800
Mama.
Shit.

908
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,524
Smokey.

909
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,943
Smokey.

910
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,154
Smokey.

911
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:51,157
Smokey, what the hell you doing
back here?

912
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:54,160
Nothing, man. I'm fixing something.
Just stay over there.

913
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:58,331
- I thought you wanted me to wash your car.
- Hey, man. Wash it later. Stay over there.

914
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,333
I'm not the smartest man in the world...

915
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:02,835
...but from here
it looks like you taking a shit.

916
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,171
Ezal, get the hell out of my backyard.

917
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,423
You been eating corn, huh?

918
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:10,468
Man, get the hell out of my backyard,
man.

919
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:15,640
All right, nigga, look. When you're done,
I'll clean all that shit up for you for $2.

920
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:17,683
Hey, Ezal.

921
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,936
- What?
- You better not tell nobody, man.

922
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,437
I'm not, man.

923
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:25,775
- Keep it on down low.
- I'm not like that. I'm gonna keep it down.

924
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,986
Hey, Smokey's back here taking a shit!

925
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,863
Ezal!

926
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,950
Well, I ain't gonna tell nobody else.

927
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:41,207
You need to control
that little funky ass temper.

928
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,501
I know.
I be forgetting, baby.

929
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:47,547
You gotta be reminding me.
I'm sorry.

930
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,091
My mama know that's you calling
and hanging up.

931
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:51,843
Why?

932
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,720
That ain't me calling
and hanging up, baby.

933
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,973
You know I love your mama.

934
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,683
Hey, you got some money?

935
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:00,351
What?

936
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:01,936
Some huh?

937
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,063
Nigga, how much you need?

938
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:05,481
About 200 dollars.

939
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,068
Well, I guess so.

940
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:11,237
What you gonna give me?

941
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,240
Craig.

942
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,617
Craig.

943
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,913
Craig. Craig.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

944
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,249
What?

945
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:24,584
What?

946
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,170
Can I use y'all's VCR right quick?
Wanna dub a tape.

947
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,881
- Hell, no.
- It's The Mack.

948
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,260
Wait a minute.
Who the fuck is that bitch?

949
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,595
Fuck you, motherfucker.

950
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,264
You think you're slick,
gonna ask me for some money.

951
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,516
Go ask that bitch for some money.

952
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,564
Damn.

953
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,482
What's wrong with your ho?

954
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,152
Damn.

955
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:55,448
We had the money, right here,
my motherfucker.

956
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,575
We ain't have shit.

957
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,453
So, what we gonna do?

958
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,581
That fool's just playing, man.

959
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:05,541
I ain't sweating it.

960
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:07,710
That's your problem.

961
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:11,130
Ain't nobody playing but you.

962
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:15,134
You walk up and down this street
all day playing.

963
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:19,430
He ain't playing.
You think he playing about his money?

964
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:22,475
You done dragged me into this.

965
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:25,978
He know where my mama stay,
know where your mama stay.

966
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,148
You say he had a gun
when you've seen him, right?

967
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:31,442
- Yeah.
- Name one person in the hood...

968
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,653
...that play like that.

969
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,824
I know, huh?

970
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,675
Look, man...

971
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,762
...I'm sorry I got you in this shit.

972
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:04,350
I'm gonna tell him
you ain't got nothing to do with it.

973
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,686
I smoked up his weed.

974
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,398
I'm gonna face the consequences.

975
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,028
If I get dealt with, I get dealt with.

976
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:42,430
Hey, Craig, have you seen my shoe...?

977
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,184
What's that for?

978
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,522
Protection.

979
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,066
Protection?

980
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:55,901
Protection from who?

981
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,071
Me and Smokey...

982
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,867
I got to walk Smokey down to his house.

983
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:06,037
Oh, man.

984
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,080
I never would've moved in...

985
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:11,167
...if we had known you need a gun
to walk down the damn street.

986
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:13,919
You know how it is around here.

987
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:17,548
Oh, no, son.
That's not the way it is.

988
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:21,093
You kids today ain't nothing but punks.
Sissified.

989
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,847
So quick to pick up a gun.

990
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,350
You scared to take an ass whipping.

991
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,145
This what makes you a man.

992
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:35,149
When I was growing up,
this was all the protection we needed.

993
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:38,444
You win some, you lose some.

994
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:42,782
But you live,
you live to fight another day.

995
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:46,494
You think you're a man
with that gun in your hand, don't you?

996
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:50,456
I'm a man without it.

997
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:52,458
Put the gun down.

998
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,461
Come on, put up your dukes.

999
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,674
Now you're a man.

1000
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,635
Your uncle picked up a gun too.

1001
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:05,054
He had to find out the hard way.

1002
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:08,224
22 years old.

1003
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,643
You got a choice.

1004
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:12,269
These are all you need.

1005
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,813
All right?

1006
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:25,658
What's up, man?
- What's up, Red?

1007
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,327
- Get your ass up.
- Oh.

1008
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:32,206
Oh, they was clowning you
at work today, man.

1009
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:33,874
- So what?
- I saw the tape.

1010
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:35,167
We kept rewinding it.

1011
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:38,421
It kind of looked like your head,
but you can't tell from the back.

1012
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:42,508
- How your eye?
- Oh, it's cool.

1013
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:45,678
Damn!

1014
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,972
Put your glasses back on.

1015
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,354
What's up, Craig?
What's up, Red?

1016
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,440
Hey, Smokey.
Sell me a dub.

1017
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,276
I ain't selling you nada.

1018
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:01,652
Oh, come on, homes.

1019
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,696
Let's let bygones be bygones.

1020
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:06,532
Race the fuck off
before Craig's father come out here.

1021
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,159
You need to go on and do that.

1022
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,202
Hey, I ain't selling him shit.

1023
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,288
Better get your ass off your shoulders.

1024
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:15,166
You ain't gonna get me shot up.
You better make that money.

1025
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,543
- Hurry up.
- Hey, ese.

1026
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,757
Man, this nigger...

1027
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,135
...got us in some shit.

1028
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:29,221
That shit was fucked up.
- It's all right. You have nice legs.

1029
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:30,389
Fuck you.

1030
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,479
Shit, here comes Deebo.

1031
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,523
Who?
- Deebo.

1032
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:43,235
I'm gonna just tuck mine in.

1033
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,378
What's up, y'all?

1034
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:03,506
What's up, Red?

1035
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,883
Thanks for the bike.

1036
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,927
Where you got my 40, homey?

1037
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,595
I thought you had 200 dollars.

1038
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:11,889
I do.

1039
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:14,517
But I wanna spend Red's money.

1040
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:16,560
I'm broke.

1041
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:17,895
Give it up, Red.

1042
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:20,189
Come on, Deebo, stall him out.

1043
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:21,982
Where you got on my 40, homey?

1044
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,567
I don't have nothing.

1045
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:25,778
Yeah, you got something.

1046
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,784
- Why are you tripping, Deebo?
- Shut up or I knock your ass.

1047
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:34,954
Oh, man, that's messed up.
Why don't you give him back his chain?

1048
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,373
What chain?

1049
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,625
Yeah, what chain?

1050
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:50,511
Hey, why you didn't help me?

1051
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:52,429
Man, I'm high.

1052
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:56,141
Man, that's fucked up, man.
If it was y'all, I would've helped y'all.

1053
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,144
What about the time he tried to choke me
in Smoke's backyard?

1054
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,729
Yeah.

1055
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,315
That was different.

1056
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,276
Men, let's jump him.

1057
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,445
Sit your ass down.

1058
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:11,031
Man, I got mind control over Deebo.

1059
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,576
He be, like, "Shut the fuck up."

1060
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,160
I be quiet.

1061
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,204
But when he leave...

1062
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:19,373
...I be talking again.

1063
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:23,002
Man, my grandmama
gave me that chain.

1064
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:25,254
He tripping hard.

1065
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,089
Only on people he know.

1066
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,801
He don't be pulling that shit
on them fools around the corner.

1067
01:05:34,723 --> 01:05:37,141
Man, fuck that.

1068
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,486
He gonna cry in the car.

1069
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,242
Here come Dana.

1070
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,703
- And her punk ass boyfriend.
Bye, baby.

1071
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,710
What are you doing with that
on your head?

1072
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:06,670
Don't even ask.

1073
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:09,757
All right, don't get homeboy fucked up.

1074
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:11,675
Debbie came by looking for you.

1075
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:13,552
For real?
What she say?

1076
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,721
She just said to tell you she came by.

1077
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:17,723
All right.

1078
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,434
Hey, Dana.

1079
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:22,728
- When we gonna hook up?
- Boy, please.

1080
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:25,564
Elvira. Elvira!

1081
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:27,983
That's okay!

1082
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,943
She'll be back.

1083
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:33,989
Another Quaalude,
she'll love me in the morning.

1084
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:36,241
- Ain't that right, friend?
- Get off me.

1085
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:40,371
- Oh! He's crazy! He's crazy!
- Oh, shit.

1086
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,081
He's crazy!

1087
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:50,714
- He's going off.
Goddamn preacher.

1088
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:53,175
Craig.

1089
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:56,053
Craig, Daddy wants you.

1090
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,346
Look.

1091
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:02,142
- What Daddy want?
- I don't know. Go see.

1092
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,936
Craig.

1093
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:07,022
- Tell me if anything happens.
- Go see.

1094
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:12,569
Hey, what's up with me and you?

1095
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:16,031
I in there was on the phone with Debbie,
and what's up with Rita?

1096
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:19,618
- Rita who?
- Rita that's gonna be here at 7:30.

1097
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,040
Girl, that's my friend.

1098
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:28,460
Dana, wait up.

1099
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:32,756
Anything else happen?

1100
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:34,341
No.

1101
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:37,302
Look at Ezal.

1102
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,768
Scandalous.

1103
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:48,731
Damn.

1104
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:49,940
Is Dana in there?

1105
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:52,484
Yeah.
Just go on and knock.

1106
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:55,779
- What's your name?
China. Excuse me.

1107
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:00,951
- Stop.
Don't come here with that attitude.

1108
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,203
What's up?
- Nothing. Just got off that bus.

1109
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:05,497
- Did you remember to pick up the hair?
- Yeah.

1110
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:06,999
Daddy wants you again.

1111
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:08,834
Damn.

1112
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:12,004
- What he want?
Go see.

1113
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:13,255
Outrun the dog.

1114
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:16,925
Run.
Go for the tree, Mr. Postman. Go.

1115
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:18,844
Huh?

1116
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:20,095
Get me glass of water.

1117
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,022
It's your ass, Mr. Postman.

1118
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:33,358
I look like the Kunta Kinte
around this mother?

1119
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:48,207
Go, go, go.
Go.

1120
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:52,377
- Took long enough.
- I know.

1121
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:06,266
All right, here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna run here and get you the gun.

1122
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:09,144
Then I'm gonna go home to chill.
You wait for them niggers.

1123
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:12,731
And later on, you call me
and let me know what happened, all right?

1124
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,526
You're making me nervous, okay?

1125
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,945
Hey, I'm tripping. I ain't scared of shit.
I'm doing good.

1126
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,865
Stop.

1127
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,700
- Damn.
- All right.

1128
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,578
Damn.

1129
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,680
Whose car is that?

1130
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:46,598
I don't know.

1131
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:49,184
I don't know who car that is.

1132
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,270
Hey, what time is it?

1133
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:52,938
Seven forty-five.

1134
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:59,069
Oh.
Nigger, that's Janet Jackson.

1135
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,196
- Who?
- Janet Jackson.

1136
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,615
- The girl Debbie hooked me up with.
- Oh.

1137
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,869
Hey, hold up.
I'll be right back.

1138
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:12,624
Hey, see if she got a friend.
- All right.

1139
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:17,838
Ooh.
What's up?

1140
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:21,466
Not a damn thing.

1141
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,608
So we gonna kick it or what?

1142
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:44,281
We can kick it, but I forgot
I have to go pick up my mom from work.

1143
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:45,908
Hey, you know how that is.

1144
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,327
- That's all right. I'll take you to get her.
- No.

1145
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,829
She don't like people with me
when I go get her.

1146
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:53,749
Who's that girl Smokey's talking to?

1147
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:55,834
Some girl he hooked up with.

1148
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:57,961
She's a big one.

1149
01:10:58,129 --> 01:10:59,755
Humongous.

1150
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:02,424
Go and get something to eat.
I know you hungry.

1151
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:06,845
Oh, Lord, let me go inside and see
what's going on with this crazy man.

1152
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:09,598
- I'm right behind you.
- Okay.

1153
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:16,021
- Uh-uh because I ate twice before I came.
- Goddamn!

1154
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,691
Craig, where the iron?

1155
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:21,568
Right there.

1156
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:29,201
Hey, Dana?

1157
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:33,372
- What?
- Loan me 200 dollars.

1158
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:36,458
Me and Smokey got into it
with Big Worm today.

1159
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:38,669
We owe him 200 dollars.

1160
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:41,505
He said if we don't pay him,
he gonna kill us.

1161
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,215
Are you gonna loan me the money?

1162
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,217
Not.

1163
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:53,809
- You gonna call me?
- I'm gonna call you.

1164
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,979
But if you come by,
I won't call you, okay?

1165
01:11:57,146 --> 01:12:00,649
Don't ever, ever...

1166
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,609
...ever, ever, ever...

1167
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:04,403
...come by here.

1168
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,904
Okay?

1169
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:08,657
- Okay.
- All right.

1170
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,535
Bye, Smokey.

1171
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,581
Debbie girl, damn.

1172
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,918
Craig.
Telephone.

1173
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:22,212
- Who is it?
- That girl.

1174
01:12:23,423 --> 01:12:25,090
- Tell her I'll call her back.
- Okay.

1175
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:26,717
Hey, Mama.

1176
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:28,468
What?

1177
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,262
Loan me 200 dollars.

1178
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:36,685
Craig, I wouldn't feel comfortable
lending you 200 dollars without a job.

1179
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:39,521
If I was working,
I wouldn't need 200 dollars.

1180
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,481
Exactly.

1181
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,613
Y'all ain't never got no money.

1182
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:52,034
I hate living around
a bunch of broke-ass people.

1183
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,959
Shit.

1184
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,629
Come here.

1185
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,423
What?

1186
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:09,801
Why you hook me up
with that fat-ass baldhead girl?

1187
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:11,553
- Who, Rita?
- Yeah.

1188
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:14,097
Rita is not fat, she's just big-boned.

1189
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:15,682
Shit.

1190
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:18,185
That girl wider than all outside.

1191
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:21,521
- Talking about she look like Janet Jackson.
- Ooh. She didn't go there?

1192
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:24,483
Bitch got out of the car
looking more like Freddie Jackson.

1193
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,611
- Don't laugh.
It ain't funny.

1194
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:29,738
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1195
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:33,283
I'm not trying to laugh. I just thought
you two would like each other.

1196
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:36,161
You knew she was bald head.
You knew she had no damn hair.

1197
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,499
Don't laugh.
It ain't funny.

1198
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,668
Aw.
I'm sorry.

1199
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,671
What Deebo doing over here?

1200
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,924
Oh, he's in there asleep with Felisha.

1201
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:53,261
- Felisha fucking Deebo too?
- Could you mind your own business.

1202
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,513
Where your mama at?

1203
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,516
My mama is in Vegas with her boyfriend.

1204
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,726
So y'all just parlaying up in here, huh?

1205
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:02,312
- Oh, shit.
Party over here.

1206
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,814
What?

1207
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:05,690
What?

1208
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:06,942
Bye-bye.

1209
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:08,819
Oh, you tripping.

1210
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:10,821
I'm out of here anyway.

1211
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:13,031
Peace out.

1212
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,583
Nasty motherfucker.

1213
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:49,711
Damn.

1214
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:53,673
- Smokey? What are you doing in here?
- What the hell are you doing here?

1215
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,969
- I see the window open so I said fuck it.
- Get the hell out of here.

1216
01:15:58,137 --> 01:16:01,556
- All right, man. Look, here, loan me $2.
- Man, get the fuck out.

1217
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:16,821
Damn.

1218
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,658
Fucking bitch.

1219
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:30,752
I'm clowning.

1220
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,546
Janet Jackson ass get just a little fat.

1221
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:35,423
Man, forget that.

1222
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:36,675
I almost had the money.

1223
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:39,469
- What?
- That money we stole from Stanley house?

1224
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:41,096
- Me and Deebo?
- Yeah.

1225
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:43,974
Deebo was over at Felisha house
and Debbie house asleep.

1226
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:46,768
Man, I snuck through the back window
to get the money.

1227
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:50,772
Just when I was gonna get the money,
Ezal come running and woke him up.

1228
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:54,025
- Damn.
- I tried to beat his ass, but he ran.

1229
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:56,403
Oh, you ain't catching no crackhead.

1230
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:59,239
Let's just go back over there.
He probably still asleep.

1231
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:01,366
- For real?
- Yeah, you breaking in though.

1232
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:02,659
- You with me?
- I got you.

1233
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:03,868
- Let's go.
- All right.

1234
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:06,788
Damn.

1235
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:15,839
Oh, well...

1236
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:17,966
...forget that plan.

1237
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,884
What time is it?

1238
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:22,137
08:50.

1239
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:25,015
I'm just gonna go in the house
and chill, man.

1240
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:28,310
Oh. Now you're scared.
You wanna go in and lay down?

1241
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,061
Man, hell, no.

1242
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,564
Nobody gonna run me up in my house
like no bitch.

1243
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:34,232
This my hood.

1244
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,525
Fuck Worm.

1245
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:37,068
Boo.

1246
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:39,612
Punk.

1247
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:44,492
Man, y'all busters can't catch me.

1248
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:53,877
Hold him.

1249
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:56,421
All right, man.
All right, man.

1250
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,970
Mama!

1251
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,432
All right, man.
We finally got him.

1252
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,934
We just did it.
We got that little motherfucker.

1253
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:11,478
Calm down.

1254
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:12,937
What?

1255
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,607
Who car is that coming up creeping?

1256
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:20,862
Drive-by.

1257
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:39,130
Get off my ass.

1258
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,174
Hey, let's go in the house.

1259
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,818
Slipping.

1260
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:03,238
I wish you weren't slipping today.

1261
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:08,952
Shit.

1262
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,495
Who is that?

1263
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:12,497
Big Worm.

1264
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,177
Hey, um...

1265
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:27,679
...somebody...

1266
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:28,930
...page Smokey?

1267
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:32,434
Don't play dumb, nigger.
You know who this is. You got my money?

1268
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,770
Man, you don't have to holler, man.
I ain't got it yet but I'm gonna get it...

1269
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,445
What happened?

1270
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:47,365
Man, he just hung up.

1271
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,869
I think we better stay in the house.

1272
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,745
Damn.

1273
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,043
See anything?

1274
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:01,171
Man, I can't see shit.

1275
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:03,882
Stanley trees all in the way.

1276
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,469
- I'm gonna try again.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1277
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:15,226
Now Dana told me
about that Big Snake situation.

1278
01:20:15,603 --> 01:20:17,562
- Big Worm.
- Big Worm, Big Hole, Big...

1279
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,231
I don't give a damn.
Get your ass out of this house, boy.

1280
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:21,983
You always got some shit going.

1281
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:24,819
And you, you keep your ass here.

1282
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,822
Big Snake. Big Worm.
What kind of name is that?

1283
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:31,242
I bet y'all drinking that wine.
Smoking them tweeds and everything.

1284
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:35,246
Wearing them clothes all half-off your ass,
what the hell is going on today?

1285
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:37,040
- Weed.

1286
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,751
Your punk-ass dad,
he always talking shit.

1287
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:43,087
- Just wait, wait. Well, hold up.
- Tell him to comb his goddamn hair.

1288
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:46,424
Like a bunch of spiders
is having a meeting on his head.

1289
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,552
- I'm about sick of you. Naw.
- I'm sick of you.

1290
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,181
I'll walk you, man, you punk ass.

1291
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:01,523
You see him?

1292
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,775
Man, ain't nobody even out here.

1293
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:05,610
I don't even know why I'm tripping.

1294
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,612
Nobody wanna mess
with the Smoke Dog.

1295
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:12,325
Hey, who's that?

1296
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:14,953
Oh, shit.

1297
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,055
Quick, quick, quick.

1298
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:39,894
You don't know who you messing with,
Smoke Dog, nigger.

1299
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,318
Damn.

1300
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:48,736
Come on, get out of here.

1301
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,989
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

1302
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:57,829
Goddamn, goddamn.

1303
01:21:57,997 --> 01:21:59,747
Hey, hey, hey.

1304
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:02,667
- Look and see if they're gone.
- Hell, no. You look.

1305
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,419
Hey, we both look.

1306
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:06,546
- On the count of three.
- All right.

1307
01:22:06,714 --> 01:22:09,507
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

1308
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:12,218
- Craig, I thought you said on three.
- Okay. All right.

1309
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:13,928
- You ain't bullshitting?
- Come on.

1310
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,723
- One, two, three.
- All right, one, two, three.

1311
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,600
- What the fuck you...?
- You see them?

1312
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,643
- Yeah, they coming, man.
- Oh, shit.

1313
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:23,104
I ain't going ever smoke weed again.

1314
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:26,024
- Craig, I love you, man.
- Shut up.

1315
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,359
Man, don't tou...
Let me go.

1316
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:33,615
Mama.
Mama.

1317
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:36,200
Shut up, man.
Her fat ass couldn't do nothing.

1318
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:44,208
I want my mama.
Man. Man.

1319
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:49,714
I swear to you. Yeah, I shot one.
I know I shot one of them.

1320
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:51,883
Hey, hey.

1321
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,218
- Look again.
Fuck you.

1322
01:22:57,431 --> 01:22:59,223
Stanley.

1323
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:01,893
Stanley.
What's going on?

1324
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:04,562
I don't know.
It sounded like machine guns.

1325
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:06,939
Oh, Lord.

1326
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,776
- Mama, where Craig at?
- I don't know.

1327
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:13,071
There's Joann.
Go ask her if she's seen them.

1328
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,739
It sounded like a bomb.

1329
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:18,493
- Joann, you seen Craig and Smokey?
- I thought they were over there.

1330
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:20,828
Deebo.

1331
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,289
You seen Craig and Smokey around here?

1332
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:24,999
Earlier.

1333
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:27,168
Damn.

1334
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:28,961
- What she say?
- She ain't seen them.

1335
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:30,755
Deebo ain't seen them neither.

1336
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:33,049
You have to tell us
before you leave the house.

1337
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:35,635
Look at your face.
Look at your face.

1338
01:23:35,803 --> 01:23:38,638
- It will be okay. Believe me.
- No, look at your face.

1339
01:23:38,806 --> 01:23:40,390
Who do you think you are?

1340
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:43,476
- What you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

1341
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:46,229
You hit my sister
like she was a fucking man.

1342
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,690
She had no business
going through my pants.

1343
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:52,068
My sister don't need to steal nothing
from your broke ass, all right?

1344
01:23:52,236 --> 01:23:54,779
- Better take your ass home.
- I'm not scared of you.

1345
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:57,615
All these niggers around here
might be scared of you.

1346
01:23:57,783 --> 01:23:59,534
But I'm not.

1347
01:24:03,831 --> 01:24:06,874
- You take your ass home.
- No, fuck you.

1348
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,292
You're lucky I'm not a man.

1349
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,795
Otherwise, I'd kick your ass myself.

1350
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,297
Shut up!

1351
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:15,633
Deebo, man.
You tripping.

1352
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:18,136
What you say, little nigger?

1353
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,471
Man, that's a female.

1354
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:24,225
Shut your little punk ass up, nigger,
before I drop you like I did this bitch.

1355
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,477
Man, I ain't even trying to fight you,
Deebo.

1356
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:34,986
Ezal.

1357
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:39,073
I know you don't wanna fight me
because you're nothing but a bitch too.

1358
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:46,622
What you gonna do with that
besides make me mad?

1359
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:49,792
Put the gun down, son.

1360
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:51,627
Huh?

1361
01:24:53,964 --> 01:24:55,631
Put the gun down, son.

1362
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:57,008
Yeah.

1363
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:59,218
Put that gun down, son...

1364
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:01,971
...and get knocked out
like your father used to.

1365
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,310
This was all the protection we needed.

1366
01:25:07,478 --> 01:25:10,146
You win some, you lose some.

1367
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:11,522
But you live.

1368
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,858
You live to fight another day.

1369
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,944
You think you're a man
with that gun in your hand.

1370
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,030
I'm a man without it.

1371
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:24,494
Yeah.
Put that gun down, son...

1372
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:26,996
...and get knocked out
like your father used to.

1373
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,000
Give me the gun, son.

1374
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:32,210
Craig.

1375
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:33,669
Craig.

1376
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:35,213
Give me the gun.

1377
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:38,549
Give me the gun, son.

1378
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:54,315
That's all you got?

1379
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:01,906
Get him.
Damn.

1380
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:04,742
Drop him, Craig. Drop him, Craig.
Drop him, Craig.

1381
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,869
Deebo.
Damn.

1382
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:10,748
Hurry, quick.
- Craig. Oh, shit.

1383
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:14,752
There you go, Craig.

1384
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:18,256
There you go.
Get up, Craig. Get up, Craig.

1385
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:21,926
- Yeah.
- Come on, nigger.

1386
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:23,636
Yeah.

1387
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:29,267
- Yeah.
- Come on, Craig.

1388
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:40,611
Oh, shit, goddamn.

1389
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:43,197
Goddamn.

1390
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:50,746
No.
- No. No, come on, baby. Let him be a man.

1391
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:54,625
- Go to sleep. Go to sleep.
Do something.

1392
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:56,252
- Yeah.
- Do something.

1393
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:58,963
- Shoot him.
Stop it.

1394
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:02,842
- See, he's not fighting fair.
Come on, man, kill him.

1395
01:27:06,889 --> 01:27:09,515
I been down before.
I taught him better than this.

1396
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:12,101
Craig, get up.
- Get up, Craig. Come on, Craig.

1397
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:14,979
- Come on, Craig.
I told y'all.

1398
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:17,273
I told y'all.
You all want some?

1399
01:27:17,441 --> 01:27:19,150
Beat him down, beat you down.

1400
01:27:19,318 --> 01:27:20,651
Who else wants some?

1401
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:22,695
Who else wants some of Deebo?

1402
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:24,071
- Who else?
Craig, get up.

1403
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,240
Get up, Craig.
Come on, Craig.

1404
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:27,825
Come on, Craig.

1405
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:30,745
Fair enough, Craig. Fair enough.
There you go.

1406
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:32,330
All right, Craig.

1407
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:34,540
Hey, punk.

1408
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:42,298
Yes, Mr. Big Shot.

1409
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,260
Fucking... Yeah.
Crawl, punk.

1410
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:48,471
Crawl, you little bitch.

1411
01:27:49,222 --> 01:27:52,516
- Whoop him, Craig. Whoop his ass.
- There, buddy.

1412
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:55,144
Ooh.
That's what I'm talking about.

1413
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:56,479
That's my dog.

1414
01:27:56,647 --> 01:27:59,523
- Take that.
That's my dog.

1415
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:01,734
Ain't that right, Ma?
That's my dog.

1416
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,486
Mr. Parker.
Mr. Parker.

1417
01:28:04,237 --> 01:28:05,446
That's my dog.

1418
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:09,617
- That's my dog.
- Cutie pie.

1419
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:12,870
If anybody gotta say anything,
you let me know.

1420
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:15,623
That's my dog.
That's what I'm talking about.

1421
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,794
Are you okay?

1422
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:25,049
- Craig.
- No, no, cupcakes. Leave him alone.

1423
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:26,384
Now, let him be a man.

1424
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,552
I taught him good, didn't I?

1425
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,388
Now who's the punk?

1426
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,892
- He think he a mack.
- Macaroni.

1427
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:41,691
You got knocked the fuck out, man.

1428
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:44,694
Give me my goddamn money.

1429
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:48,698
Payback's a motherfucker,
ain't it, nigger?

1430
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:52,201
China, come on.

1431
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:54,537
No, Ma.

1432
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:01,293
Stop, you're embarrassing me.

1433
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:08,759
My grandmama gave me this chain.

1434
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:17,685
Deebo!

1435
01:29:18,311 --> 01:29:19,937
Deebo!

1436
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:22,940
Man, you should've been
bobbing and weaving. Look at you.

1437
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:24,608
Get up!

1438
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:28,571
Since you ain't getting up,
I'll take these shoes.

1439
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:32,366
Bigfoot motherfucker,
you can have your knife.

1440
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:34,577
Because I steal, I don't kill.

1441
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:42,960
Craig, yeah.

1442
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:45,212
How's your back feeling?

1443
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:48,049
It be cool.

1444
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:54,472
Bleeding and shit.

1445
01:29:55,474 --> 01:29:58,142
What time you waking up
in the morning?

1446
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,645
8:30, why?

1447
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:06,358
I was just wondering that maybe
if you were feeling better, um...

1448
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,736
...that you could come over.

1449
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,490
I'm feeling better already.

1450
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:20,664
I'm gonna call you tomorrow.

1451
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:22,666
All right.

1452
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:25,002
8:30, right?

1453
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,255
Yes.

1454
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:33,844
Hey, 7:30.

1455
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:40,976
That's right.

1456
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:47,316
Craig, come here.

1457
01:30:51,822 --> 01:30:53,697
- Craig.
- Huh?

1458
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,493
Shut the door and have a seat.

1459
01:30:58,370 --> 01:30:59,662
Can I leave the door open?

1460
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:01,705
Shut the door.

1461
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,712
Now you see, son. You gotta let us know
when you leave the house.

1462
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,339
What if you got killed tonight?

1463
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:12,341
We'd have to bury you.

1464
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:14,718
You know how much a funeral costs
these days?

1465
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:16,470
No.

1466
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:19,140
About 4 or $5000.

1467
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:22,059
I ain't got no 4 or $5000
to plant you in the ground.

1468
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:24,478
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1469
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:26,564
You keep your ass around this house.

1470
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:32,736
Your supervisor called about your job.
She wants you to call tomorrow.

1471
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:34,488
- For real?
- Mm-hm.

1472
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,324
Now, Craig...

1473
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,326
...I was proud of you tonight.

1474
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,704
You used your brain.

1475
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:44,331
That's what I want you to do,
use your brain.

1476
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:45,708
That's my boy.

1477
01:31:46,877 --> 01:31:48,627
That's my boy.

1478
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:58,596
Night, Mama.

1479
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:00,598
Night, baby.

1480
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:08,939
Dana.

1481
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,428
Hello?

1482
01:32:39,596 --> 01:32:41,472
Why you can't call nobody back?

1483
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:44,808
Which one of your hoes
has somebody shooting at you?

1484
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:49,939
See, I don't know why I waste my time
on your old stupid ass anyway.

1485
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:51,607
I don't know either.

1486
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:52,983
It's over.

1487
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:55,110
Bitch!

1488
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,909
Yeah, I got your money.

1489
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:05,079
I don't appreciate you sending
your punk-ass, bust-ass...

1490
01:33:05,247 --> 01:33:08,666
...Jheri-curl-ass friends
to shoot at me and my homey.

1491
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,168
They like to got dealt with.

1492
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,796
Don't be calling here
like you some straight up G...

1493
01:33:13,964 --> 01:33:17,341
...because I'll cut your balls off
and hand them to you, partner.

1494
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:20,135
I had to warn you too many times
about my money, Smokey.

1495
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:22,680
It's the principle of the whole thing.

1496
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:25,599
It's principalities in this.

1497
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:27,184
Well....

1498
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:30,062
Yeah, hey, I got your money anyway.

1499
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:32,856
And you sell that shit yourself next time.

1500
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:34,775
Because I'm going to rehab.

1501
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:37,027
I'm through with this shit.

1502
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:50,207
I was just bullshitting.

1503
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:53,877
And you know this, man.
