1
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,010
Remember, remember
The 5th of November

2
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,870
The gunpowder treason and plot

3
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,310
I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason

4
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,410
Should ever be forgot

5
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,380
But what of the man?

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,080
I know his name was Guy Fawkes...

7
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,990
and I know in 1605, he attempted
to blow up the Houses of Parliament.

8
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,390
But who was he really?

9
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,000
What was he like?

10
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,300
We are told to remember the idea
and not the man.

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,040
Because a man can fail.

12
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,210
He can be caught,
he can be killed and forgotten.

13
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,440
But 400 years later...

14
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,350
an idea can still change the world.

15
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,350
I have witnessed firsthand
the power of ideas.

16
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,950
I've seen people kill
in the name of them...

17
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,490
and die defending them.

18
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,730
But you cannot kiss an idea...

19
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,140
cannot touch it or hold it.

20
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,910
Ideas do not bleed.
They do not feel pain.

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,180
They do not love.

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,550
And it is not an idea that I miss.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,690
It is a man.

24
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,380
A man that made me remember
the 5th of November.

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,650
A man that I will never forget.

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,080
So I read that the former United States
is so desperate for medical supplies...

27
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,270
that they have allegedly sent several
containers filled with wheat and tobacco.

28
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,890
A gesture, they said, of goodwill.

29
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,920
You wanna know what I think?

30
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,720
Well, you're listening to my show,
so I will assume you do.

31
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,260
It's high time we let the colonies know
what we really think of them.

32
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,553
I think it's payback time
for a little tea party

33
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,700
they threw for us a few
hundred years ago.

34
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,070
I say we go down to those docks tonight
and dump that crap...

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,540
where everything from
the Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica belongs!

36
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,110
Who's with me? Who's bloody with me?!

37
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,880
Did you like that?

38
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,210
U.S.A., Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica.
I mean, what else can you say?

39
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,950
Here was a country that had everything,
absolutely everything...

40
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,450
and now, 20 years later, is what?

41
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,290
The world's biggest leper colony. Why?

42
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,560
Godlessness.

43
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,320
Let me say that again.

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,800
Godlessness.

45
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,500
It wasn't the war they started.
It wasn't the plague they created.

46
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,930
It was Judgment.

47
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,240
No one escapes their past.
No one escapes Judgment.

48
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,640
You think he's not up there?

49
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,310
You think he's not watching over
this country?

50
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,680
How else can you explain it?
He tested us, but we came through.

51
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,290
We did what we had to do.

52
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,530
Islington. Enfield.
I was there. I saw it all.

53
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,090
Immigrants, Muslims...

54
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,990
homosexuals, terrorists.

55
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,100
Disease-ridden degenerates.
They had to go.

56
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,430
Strength through unity.
Unity through faith.

57
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,570
I am a God-fearing Englishman,
and I'm goddamn proud of it!

58
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,110
That's quite enough of that,
thank you very much.

59
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,510
Oh, shit.

60
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,410
A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.

61
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,890
Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest.

62
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,590
This is for your protection.

63
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,030
A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.

64
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,660
Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest.

65
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,270
This is for your protection.

66
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,370
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, I didn't see you...

67
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,200
- In a hurry, are we?
- I was just...

68
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,070
- It's past curfew, you know.
- My uncle, he's very sick.

69
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,033
Sick uncle? What you
think on that, Willy?

70
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:47,840
It's a load of bollocks.

71
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,920
I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out
after curfew. I know that.

72
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,450
Maybe you could look after us
before getting back to your uncle.

73
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,750
See, my friend, he's kind of sick.
Ain't you?

74
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,760
Real sick. Bad case of the blues.
You can feel them.

75
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,630
- Don't touch me!
- Look, Willy, kitty's got claws.

76
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,560
- She just threatened us.
- That she did, that she did.

77
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,330
You know what that means,
don't you?

78
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,230
It means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion.

79
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,270
And you get to swallow it.

80
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,570
- You're Fingermen.
- She's getting the picture.

81
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,470
No, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

82
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,640
Not yet you're not. But you will be.

83
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,340
By sunup, if you're not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of London...

84
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,910
then you'll certainly be the sorest.

85
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,630
Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.

86
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,320
I'll go home.
I won't do it again, I swear! Please!

87
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,730
- What do you think, lads?
- Spare the rod, spoil the child.

88
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,490
Help me! Someone help!

89
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,000
The multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him.

90
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,210
- What the hell?!
- Bugger off!

91
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,430
Disdaining fortune,
with his brandish'd steel...

92
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,480
which smoked with bloody execution.

93
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,140
We're Fingermen, pal.

94
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,040
Jesus Christ! Mercy!

95
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,380
We are oft to blame in this...
'Tis too much proved.

96
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,390
That with devotiors visage and pious
action we do sugar o'er the devil himself.

97
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,220
- What's that mean?
- Spare the rod.

98
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,900
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.

99
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,730
- Who are you?
- Who?

100
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,340
Who is but the form
following the function of what...

101
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,340
and what I am is a man in a mask.

102
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,570
- Oh, I can see that.
- Of course you can.

103
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,870
I'm not questioning your powers
of observation.

104
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,140
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.

105
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,950
- Right.
- But on this most auspicious of nights...

106
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,420
permit me then, in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet...

107
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,720
to suggest the character
of this dramatis persona.

108
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,490
Voila!

109
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,660
In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran...

110
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,000
cast vicariously as both victim and
villain by the vicissitudes of fate.

111
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,870
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity...

112
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,530
is a vestige of the vox populi,
now vacant, vanished.

113
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,080
However, this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified...

114
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,980
and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice...

115
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,950
and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition.

116
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,220
The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta...

117
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,100
held as a votive not in vain,
for the value and veracity of such...

118
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,570
shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous.

119
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,070
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose.

120
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,180
So let me simply add that it's
my very good honor to meet you...

121
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,050
and you may call me V.

122
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,310
Are you, like, a crazy person?

123
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,510
I am quite sure they will say so.

124
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,660
But to whom, might I ask, am I speaking?

125
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,690
- I'm Evey.
- Evey?

126
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,230
E-vey. Of course you are.

127
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,100
- What does that mean?
- It means that I, like God...

128
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,500
do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence.

129
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,500
Are you hurt?

130
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,340
No, I'm fine.

131
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,200
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, I merely played my part.

132
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,080
- But tell me, do you enjoy music, Evey?
- I suppose.

133
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,280
You see, I'm a musician of sorts...

134
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,850
and on my way to give
a very special performance.

135
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,580
What kind of musician?

136
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,620
Percussion instruments
are my specialty.

137
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,130
But tonight I intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event...

138
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,320
and would be honored
if you could join me.

139
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,630
I don't think so.
I should be getting home.

140
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,360
I promise you, it'll be like
nothing you've ever seen.

141
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,300
And afterwards,
you'll return home safely.

142
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,770
All right.

143
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,140
It's beautiful up here.

144
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,710
A more perfect stage
could not be asked for.

145
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,380
I don't see any instruments.

146
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,450
Your powers of observation
continue to serve you well.

147
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,850
But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto...

148
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,330
in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts...

149
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,530
and in recognition of the imposter
that stands in her stead.

150
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,930
Tell me, do you know
what day it is, Evey?

151
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,470
- November the 4th?
- Not anymore.

152
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,910
Remember, remember
The 5th of November

153
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,150
The gunpowder treason and plot

154
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,290
I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason

155
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,990
Should ever be forgot

156
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,700
First, the overture.

157
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,760
Yes.

158
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,200
Yes, the strings.

159
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,840
Listen carefully, can you hear it?

160
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,110
Now the brass.

161
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,010
I can hear it!

162
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,080
Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!

163
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,930
- How do you do that?
- Wait.

164
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,030
Here comes the crescendo!

165
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,110
How beautiful, is it not?

166
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,960
Gentlemen, you have had four hours.
You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.

167
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,060
The Bailey area is quarantined.

168
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,460
All significant witnesses
have been detained.

169
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,860
Good. Mr. Etheridge?

170
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,060
A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.

171
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,000
The DCD was Tchaikovsky's
1812 Overture.

172
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,610
Add it to the blacklist.
I never want to hear that again.

173
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,010
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,910
We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance...

175
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,640
indicating a high percentage of
conversation concerned with the explosion.

176
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,790
Mr. Dascomb,
what are we doing about that?

177
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,360
We're calling it an emergency demolition.

178
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,550
We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the interlink.

179
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,818
Several experts have
been lined up to testify

180
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:42,930
against the Bailey's
structural integrity.

181
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,070
I want Prothero to speak on
the dangers of these old buildings...

182
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,690
and how we must avoid clinging
to the edifice of a decadent past.

183
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,540
He should conclude that the New Bailey
will become the symbol of our time...

184
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,840
and the future
that our conviction has rewarded us.

185
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,240
Mr. Heyer.

186
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,610
Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist...

187
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,150
though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.

188
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,490
We also managed to get a picture of the
girl that Creedy's men were detaining.

189
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,960
- Who is she, Mr. Finch?
- Not sure yet, sir.

190
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,650
- But we're working on several leads.
- Anything else?

191
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,630
We located the fireworks launch...

192
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,670
and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.

193
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,100
Unfortunately it appears that despite
the heavy level of sophistication...

194
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,970
these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals...

195
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,640
making them very difficult to trace.

196
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,650
Whoever he is, chancellor,
he's very good.

197
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,190
Spare us your professional annotations,
Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.

198
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,090
Apologies, chancellor.

199
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,890
Gentlemen, this is a test.

200
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,690
Moments such as these
are matters of faith.

201
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,060
To fail is to invite doubt
into everything we believe...

202
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,930
everything we have fought for.

203
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,040
Doubt will plunge this country back
into chaos, and I will not let that happen.

204
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,730
Gentlemen, I want this terrorist found...

205
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,240
and I want him to understand
what terror really means.

206
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,880
England prevails.

207
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,610
England prevails.

208
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,120
- You think people will buy this?
- Why not?

209
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,190
This is the BTN.

210
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,090
Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.

211
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,770
That's the government's job.

212
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,030
On the lighter side of things...

213
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,700
seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the Old Bailey...

214
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,940
wanted to give the old girl a grand,
albeit improvised, sendoff.

215
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,010
Although the demolition had been
planned for some time...

216
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,240
the music and the fireworks were,
according to the crew chief...

217
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,290
"definitely not on the schedule."
We'll be right back.

218
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,290
Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.

219
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,930
I saw it, the whole thing.

220
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,790
- Did you see it?
- No. Last night I was...

221
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,260
Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?

222
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,930
Evey, there you are.

223
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,260
- You are still working for me.
- Sorry, Patricia.

224
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,810
I need two espressos and three coffees.

225
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,970
And Deitrich is ready for his tea.

226
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,440
I don't get it.

227
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,680
Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask?
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?

228
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,810
It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.

229
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,250
Maybe he's just getting started.

230
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,490
Yeah?

231
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,990
Okay. A lead on the girl.

232
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,100
Look, don't get me wrong, I love it.
A cow getting crucified.

233
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,440
It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.

234
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,300
You've got to rewrite it, okay?
Gotta go.

235
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,040
I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.

236
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,970
- Mr. Deitrich...
- Gordon, please.

237
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,710
I don't need "mister" to make
this body feel any older.

238
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,510
Gordon...

239
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,620
I was on my way last night,
but there were Fingermen...

240
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,380
and I got scared and went home.

241
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,050
Sadly, after last night,
I think our curfew will only get worse.

242
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,870
Gotcha.

243
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,210
- Hey, Fred.
- All that been x-rayed?

244
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,250
Nope. They're filled with bombs.

245
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,680
Well, wait till commercials
to set them off, okay?

246
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,180
- I can't believe you watch that shit.
- What?

247
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,290
Laser Lass is banging.

248
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,160
What's all that?

249
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,440
Not sure. They just arrived.
Marked for Stage 3.

250
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,270
Must be Prothero.

251
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,780
I wish someone had the balls to tell that
brat this station ain't his playground.

252
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,410
What the hell is this?

253
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,250
Just put them over there
until I can figure out what they're for.

254
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,730
This looks serious.
Her parents were political activists.

255
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,060
- They were detained when she was 12.
- What happened to her?

256
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,570
Juvenile Reclamation Project...

257
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,900
- for five years.
- Shit.

258
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,440
We're gonna need backup,
but keep it minimal.

259
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,940
You sure about that, sir?

260
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,270
I want a chance to talk to her before she
disappears into one of Creedy's black bags.

261
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,650
Who's that?

262
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,660
Don't piss me about. You show me ID,
or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.

263
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,000
Fucking hell.

264
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,540
Come on, let's move!

265
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,100
You two, cover these elevators.
The rest of you follow me.

266
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,930
Attention. Attention.

267
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,900
Will all personnel please
evacuate the building.

268
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,830
This is not a drill.

269
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,030
Will all personnel evacuate the building.

270
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,310
What the hell's going on?

271
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,510
- It's jammed.
- Break it down.

272
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,690
Dominic!

273
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,130
Police! Out of the way!

274
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,360
Get out the way!

275
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,370
Damn it!

276
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,320
I'll tell you what I know.
I'll tell you what I know.

277
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,150
I'll tell you what I know.
England prevails.

278
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,890
- Clear the halls.
- Sir.

279
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,090
Help, Storm, help!

280
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,700
Don't touch it.

281
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,000
Dad, what's wrong with the telly?

282
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,720
Good evening, London.

283
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,190
- Allow me first to apologize...
- That's the emergency channel!

284
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,490
I do, like many of you, appreciate
the comforts of the everyday routine...

285
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,660
the security of the familiar,
the tranquility of repetition.

286
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,930
Bloody hell.

287
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,600
I enjoy them as much as any bloke.
But in the spirit of commemoration...

288
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,830
Who's that, Mum?

289
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,910
Whereby important events of the past...

290
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,110
usually associated with someone's death or
the end of some awful, bloody struggle...

291
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,880
are celebrated with a nice holiday...

292
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,580
I thought we could mark
this November the 5th...

293
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,050
a day that is, sadly,
no longer remembered...

294
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,830
by taking some time out of our daily
lives to sit down and have a little chat.

295
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,990
There are, of course,
those who do not want us to speak.

296
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,430
Let me think, let me think.

297
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,090
Even now, orders are being shouted
into telephones...

298
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,470
and men with guns
will soon be on their way.

299
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,470
- It's Chancellor Sutler.
- Damn it!

300
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,010
Why? Because while the truncheon
may be used in lieu of conversation...

301
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,980
words will always retain their power.

302
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,620
Words offer the means to meaning...

303
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,980
and, for those who will listen,
the enunciation of truth.

304
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,550
And the truth is...

305
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,120
there is something terribly wrong
with this country, isn't there?

306
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,690
You designed it, wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!

307
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,460
Cruelty and injustice,
intolerance and oppression.

308
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,970
And where once
you had the freedom to object...

309
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,930
to think and speak as you saw fit...

310
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,340
you now have censors and surveillance
coercing your conformity...

311
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,340
and soliciting submission.
Cameras. We need cameras.

312
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,170
How did this happen? Who's to blame?

313
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,620
Certainly there are those
who are more responsible than others.

314
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,680
And they will be held accountable.

315
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,820
But again, truth be told,
if you're looking for the guilty...

316
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,720
you need only look into a mirror.

317
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,020
I know why you did it.

318
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,890
I know you were afraid.

319
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,590
Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease.

320
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,460
There were a myriad of problems
which conspired...

321
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,000
to corrupt your reason
and rob you of your common sense.

322
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,770
Fear got the best of you.

323
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,170
And in your panic, you turned to
the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.

324
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,870
He promised you order,
he promised you peace...

325
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,810
and all he demanded in return
was your silent, obedient consent.

326
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,750
- Inspector, they're almost through.
- Last night, I sought to end that silence.

327
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,220
Last night,
I destroyed the Old Bailey...

328
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,760
to remind this country
of what it has forgotten.

329
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,260
More than 400 years ago, a great citizen
wished to imbed the 5th of November...

330
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,900
forever in our memory.

331
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,730
His hope was to remind the world
that fairness, justice and freedom...

332
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,900
are more than words.

333
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,670
They are perspectives.

334
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,710
So if you've seen nothing...

335
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,650
if the crimes of this government
remain unknown to you...

336
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,080
then I would suggest that you allow
the 5th of November to pass unmarked.

337
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,380
But if you see what I see...

338
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,120
if you feel as I feel,
and if you would seek as I seek...

339
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,200
then I ask you to stand beside me,
one year from tonight...

340
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,530
outside the gates of Parliament.

341
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,430
And together, we shall give them
a 5th of November...

342
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,800
that shall never, ever be forgot.

343
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,110
Kerosene fog.
He's using our smoke machines.

344
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,810
Cover the exits.

345
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,750
No one gets out.
The rest of you, follow me.

346
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,390
Left.

347
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,960
You go right.

348
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,750
Spread out.

349
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,470
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!

350
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,330
Hold your fire!

351
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,470
He put masks on all of us.

352
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,910
Jesus.

353
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,580
- Don't shoot!
- Wait!

354
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,310
- Wait!
- Hold your fire!

355
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,650
Freeze! Nobody move!

356
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,090
If you're wearing a mask,
get down on your knees!

357
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,430
- Get their masks off.
- Please hurry!

358
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,130
There's a bomb in the control booth.

359
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,930
Oh, no.

360
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,270
- Jones, get anyone not wearing a mask out.
- Yes, sir.

361
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,810
- Marshal, help carry this man.
- Sir.

362
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,540
Everyone else, let's go.

363
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,480
Good God.

364
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,060
Hurry up, you lot! Come on!
Everybody out!

365
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,870
Dascomb.

366
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,910
Have you any idea how long
it would take to rebuild this facility?

367
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,130
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

368
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,470
Wait, wait!

369
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,150
Don't shoot me, please! It's him! It's him!

370
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,810
On your knees! On your knees!

371
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,380
Please! Please don't hurt me!

372
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,080
Here we go.

373
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,120
I did it.

374
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,720
I did it.

375
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,900
Freeze!

376
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,860
Get your hands on your head.
Do it now or I shoot.

377
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,300
I must say that I am rather astonished
by the response time of Londons finest.

378
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,540
I hadn't expected you to be
quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.

379
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,310
We were here before you even started.
Bad luck, chummy.

380
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,780
I don't know about that.

381
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,423
We're interrupting your
regularly scheduled

382
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:07,600
program to bring you this
terrifying report...

383
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,400
of a terrorist takeover of Jordan Tower
which ended only moments ago.

384
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,800
A psychotic terrorist,
identified only as the letter V...

385
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,940
attacked the control booth with
high-powered explosives and weapons...

386
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,240
that he used against unarmed civilians
in order to broadcast a message of hate.

387
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,020
We've just received this footage
of a daring police raid.

388
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,830
Stop! Stop, stay where you are,
or we'll shoot! Stay where you are!

389
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,330
Now, this is only an initial report...

390
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,500
but at this time, it's believed
that during this heroic raid...

391
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,500
the terrorist was shot and killed.

392
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,900
Bollocks.

393
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,530
Again, from what we've been told
by authorities, the danger is now over.

394
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,340
The terrorist is dead.

395
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,220
Right there. What's he thinking?

396
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,850
Is he considering leaving her?

397
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,460
After she just saved him?

398
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,690
He's a terrorist. You can't expect him
to act like you or me.

399
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,920
Some part of him's human.

400
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,030
And, for better or worse,
she's stuck with him.

401
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,620
- You scared me.
- My apologies.

402
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,720
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, thank you.

403
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,330
- What is this place?
- It's my home.

404
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,960
- I call it the Shadow Gallery.
- It's beautiful.

405
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,070
- Where did you get all this stuff?
- Oh, here and there.

406
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,830
Much of it from the vaults of
the Ministry of Objectionable Materials.

407
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,940
- You stole them?
- Heavens, no.

408
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,980
Stealing implies ownership.

409
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,310
You can't steal from the censor.
I merely reclaimed them.

410
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,250
God, if they ever find this place...

411
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:15,380
I suspect if they do, a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries.

412
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,820
You mean, after what you've done.

413
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,660
God, what have I done?

414
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,960
I Maced that detective.
Why did I do that?

415
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,690
- You did what you thought was right.
- No, I shouldn't have done that.

416
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,800
I must have been out of my mind.

417
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,200
Is that what you really think,
or what they'd want you to think?

418
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,200
I think I should go.

419
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,430
- May I ask where?
- Home. I have to go home.

420
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:40,550
They're looking for you. If they know
where you work, they know where you live.

421
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,550
- I have friends, I could stay with them.
- I'm afraid that won't work either.

422
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,850
You have to understand, Evey,
I didn't want this for either of us...

423
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,680
but I couldn't see any other way.

424
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,120
You were unconscious
and I had to make a decision.

425
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:57,490
If I had left you there, right now you'd be
in one of Creedy's interrogation cells.

426
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,570
They'd imprison you, torture you,
and, in all probability, kill you...

427
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,700
in the pursuit of finding me.

428
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,270
After what you did,
I couldn't let that happen...

429
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,430
so I picked you up and carried you
to the only place I knew you'd be safe:

430
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,200
Here, to my home.

431
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,150
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
You know you can trust me.

432
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,750
I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.

433
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,910
But I don't even know where this is.

434
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,080
You know it's underground.
You know the color of the stone.

435
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:28,290
- That'd be enough for a clever man.
- Are you saying that I have to stay here?

436
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,830
Only until I'm done. After the 5th,
I no longer think it'll matter.

437
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,970
You mean a year from now?

438
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,930
I have to stay here for a year?

439
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,070
Sorry, Evey.
I didn't know what else to do.

440
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,900
You should've left me alone.

441
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,440
Why didn't you just leave me alone?!

442
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,440
- Anything else on the parents?
- Yeah, it ain't good.

443
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,640
They were interned at Belmarsh.

444
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,510
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

445
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,090
She died in a hunger strike.
He died when the military retook the shed.

446
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,550
And that ain't the worst of it.
Her brother was at St. Mary's.

447
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,890
- Christ.
- It's nothing but bad luck here.

448
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:07,770
So we know her story. Now we need his.

449
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,790
V?

450
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,020
I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.

451
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,860
I understand what you did for me,
and I want you to know I am grateful.

452
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,400
Your hands.

453
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,370
Yes.

454
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,340
There, that's better.

455
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,570
I hope I didn't put you off your appetite.

456
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,623
No, please. It's just...
Are you all right?

457
00:30:57,636 --> 00:30:59,520
Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine.

458
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,120
Can I ask what happened?

459
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,180
There was a fire. A long time ago.

460
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,490
Ancient history, for some.

461
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,530
Not really very good table conversation.

462
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,360
Now, would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg?

463
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,130
- Yes, thank you. I'm starving, actually.
- Have a seat.

464
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,840
- It's delicious.
- Good.

465
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,110
God, I haven't had real butter
since I was a little girl.

466
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,510
Where did you get it?

467
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,880
A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.

468
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,760
- You stole this from Chancellor Sutler?
- Yes.

469
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,150
You're insane.

470
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,200
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none.

471
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,800
- Macbeth.
- Very good.

472
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,900
My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me...

473
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,340
and ever since,
I've always wanted to act.

474
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,910
Be in plays, movies.

475
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,640
When I was 9, I played Viola
in Twelfth Night. Mum was very proud.

476
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,870
Where is your mother now?

477
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,850
She's dead.

478
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,250
I'm sorry.

479
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,813
Can I ask about what
you said on the telly?

480
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,060
Yes.

481
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,820
- Did you mean it?
- Every word.

482
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,930
You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?

483
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,390
There's no certainty, only opportunity.

484
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:20,130
You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up...

485
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,200
Creedy'll black-bag every one of them.

486
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,940
People should not be afraid
of their governments.

487
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,970
Governments should be afraid
of their people.

488
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,540
And you'll make that happen
by blowing up a building?

489
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:34,250
The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.

490
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,180
Symbols are given power by people.

491
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,120
Alone, a symbol is meaningless,
but with enough people...

492
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,950
blowing up a building
can change the world.

493
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,890
I wish I believed that was possible.

494
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:50,590
But every time I've seen this world change,
it's always been for the worse.

495
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,760
I'll tell you what I know.
I know this is not a man.

496
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,930
- What is he?
- A man does not wear a mask.

497
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,728
What is he?

498
00:32:59,741 --> 00:33:01,370
A man does not threaten
innocent civilians.

499
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,010
He's what every gutless,
freedom-hating terrorist is:

500
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,410
A goddamn coward!

501
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,920
There will be no negotiation.

502
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,580
When I arrive in the morning,
the Paddy will be gone.

503
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,250
I'm looking at the tape right now,
and he has no idea how to light me.

504
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,120
My nose looks like Big fucking Ben.

505
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,750
Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!

506
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,730
So does every lazy cunt on this show,
and that includes you.

507
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,170
Find another DOP
or find yourself another job.

508
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,230
I'll tell you what I wish.

509
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,370
I wish I'd been there.

510
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,640
I wish I'd had the chance
for a face-to-face.

511
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,610
Just one chance, that's all I'd need.

512
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,920
This so-called V and his accomplice,
Evey Hammond...

513
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:54,390
neo-demagogues,
spouting their message of hate.

514
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,120
A delusional and aberrant voice
delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.

515
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,000
An ultimatum that was met
with swift and surgically precise justice.

516
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,970
- No mercy!
- The moral, ladies and gentlemen, is:

517
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,340
Good guys win, bad guys lose...

518
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,910
and, as always, England prevails!

519
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,850
Holy Christ! Jesus!

520
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,120
Good evening, Commander Prothero.

521
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,850
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?

522
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,150
Don't worry, I've made sure
our reunion won't be disturbed by...

523
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,560
any pesky late-night phone calls,
commander.

524
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,530
Stop. Why do you keep calling me that?

525
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,460
That was your title, remember?
When we first met, all those years ago.

526
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,360
You wore a uniform in those days.

527
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,130
You.

528
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:46,000
- It is you.
- The Ghost of Christmas Past.

529
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,450
- Yeah?
- Finch, it's Dascomb.

530
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,730
- Dascomb.
- I've already called the chancellor.

531
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,730
- We have to get control of the situation.
- What situation?

532
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,290
Chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious
reasons, we have to keep this discreet.

533
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,030
In the wrong light,
the loss of the Voice of London...

534
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,230
could be devastating to our credibility.

535
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,200
Perhaps a stroke?

536
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,150
No, no, it's too horrific.

537
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,050
A quiet, dignified death in his sleep.

538
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,980
- We got any eyes or ears on this?
- No, camcos were cut.

539
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,650
It's the same m.o. As before.
But we got an elevator log ID.

540
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,230
- Let me guess.
- She's in deep, inspector.

541
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,290
V?

542
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,240
My fat, metal friend.

543
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,790
Mondego.

544
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,490
Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.

545
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,330
No, I just thought you were fighting.
I mean, for real.

546
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,800
My favorite film:

547
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:21,430
The Count of Monte Cristo,
with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.

548
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,840
It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.

549
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,610
It gets me every time.

550
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,810
- Never seen it.
- Really?

551
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,250
- Would you like to?
- Does it have a happy ending?

552
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,680
As only celluloid can deliver.

553
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,550
Okay.

554
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,690
Put the sword away.

555
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,130
Forensics just wrapped.

556
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,960
No prints, no hair, no fibers.
The guy is like a ghost.

557
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,960
You won't believe
what they found on Prothero.

558
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,190
- Drugs?
- Could've started his own hospital.

559
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,930
- Interesting.
- Why?

560
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,510
Did you know Lewis Prothero was
one of the richest men in the country...

561
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,440
before he was
the Voice of London?

562
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:00,080
- Drugs?
- Legal ones.

563
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,010
Major stockholder
in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.

564
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,420
Viadoxic and St. Mary's
in less than a week. Coincidence?

565
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,120
When you're at this as long as I've been,
you stop believing in coincidence.

566
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,620
May we come up?

567
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,320
- You find your own tree.
- You find your own tree.

568
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,830
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

569
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,840
- But it made me feel sorry for Mercedes.
- Why?

570
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,840
Because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her.

571
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,550
Nationwide were devastated
as news of the most popular...

572
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,950
Wait. What's this?

573
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,820
Most awarded stars
in the history of the BTN...

574
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,080
a man known to the entire nation
as "The Voice of London"...

575
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,060
passed away late last night
from apparent heart failure.

576
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,490
- She's lying.
- How do you know?

577
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,660
She blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false.

578
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,000
It came as no surprise
to those who knew him...

579
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,900
that his body was at his office...

580
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,810
where he often worked long hours
after everyone else had gone home.

581
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,500
Lewis, you will be sorely missed.

582
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,180
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.

583
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,050
You didn't take it, did you?

584
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,250
Would you prefer a lie or the truth?

585
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,190
Did you have anything to do with that?

586
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,300
- Yes, I killed him.
- You...

587
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,940
- Oh, God.
- You're upset.

588
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,570
I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.

589
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,140
I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.

590
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,780
- What?
- Violence can be used for good.

591
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,710
- What are you talking about?
- Justice.

592
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,150
Oh, I see.

593
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,120
There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.

594
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,620
And are you going to kill more people?

595
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,430
Yes.

596
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,900
Take a look at this.

597
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,540
Prothero's military record.

598
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,870
What do you see?

599
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:12,010
Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.

600
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,770
- Busy boy.
- But after all that...

601
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,610
they put him in charge
of a detention facility at Larkhill.

602
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,580
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

603
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,720
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?

604
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:28,760
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.

605
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:33,260
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.

606
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,770
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.

607
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,310
- You're welcome to review our records.
- We've been through your records.

608
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,000
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill...

609
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,710
approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.

610
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,010
Well, there you have it.

611
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,510
This is a matter of some urgency, major.

612
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,850
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.

613
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,350
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.

614
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:03,290
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?

615
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,560
- Usual undesirables, I should think.
- But do you know?

616
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,640
- Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
- Do you know who was?

617
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,000
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records...

618
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:17,700
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.

619
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,810
As head of the Detention Program
at that...

620
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,850
Before you go any further, let me remind
you things were very chaotic back then.

621
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,720
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.

622
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,480
We all did what we had to do.

623
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,890
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.

624
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,890
That's all I have to say about that.

625
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,000
You can do this.

626
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,580
Hi.

627
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,740
I've been thinking...

628
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,080
There's something I want to ask you...

629
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,090
but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.

630
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,860
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.

631
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,200
He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth...

632
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,800
while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.

633
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,130
A man after my own heart.

634
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,970
He always told the best stories.

635
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,440
Until my brother died.

636
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,750
That was when everything changed.

637
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,080
My brother was one of the students
at St. Mary's.

638
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,090
After he died,
my parents became political.

639
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,660
They protested the war
and the Reclamation.

640
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:48,500
When Sutler was appointed high chancellor,
they were at the riot in Leeds.

641
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,640
I watched on the television...

642
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,240
thinking I was going
to see my parents killed.

643
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,280
I remember them arguing at night.

644
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,780
Mum wanted to leave the country.
Dad refused.

645
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,970
He said if we ran away, they would win.

646
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,810
Win, like... it was a game.

647
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,450
Evey, quick, hide!

648
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,370
- Mummy!
- Evey!

649
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,940
I never saw them again.

650
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,280
It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.

651
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,210
I'm sorry, Evey.

652
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,980
No, I'm the one that's sorry.

653
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,450
Sorry I'm not a stronger person.

654
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,610
Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...

655
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,480
but I'm not.

656
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,360
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...

657
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,500
but I am.

658
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:57,230
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.

659
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,210
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right...

660
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,340
please let me know.

661
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,170
If you wish.

662
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,380
Do you really think
you'll find something here?

663
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,080
Worth a shot.

664
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,020
One thing is true of all governments:

665
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,000
The most reliable records
are tax records.

666
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,810
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.

667
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,880
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.

668
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:44,040
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.

669
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,480
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.

670
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:49,120
Thanks. This is a great help.

671
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:04,060
"By the power of truth, I, while living,
have conquered the universe."

672
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,370
- Personal motto?
- From Faust.

673
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,980
That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?

674
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,310
It is. And speaking of the devil...

675
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,240
I was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing.

676
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,750
- Of course.
- It appears unforeseen circumstances...

677
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,720
have accelerated my original plan.

678
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:24,620
As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.

679
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,050
I'll do my best.

680
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,320
I believe you will.

681
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:36,800
Another doctor. Why does
a detention facility need so many doctors?

682
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:38,870
I don't know, but this is interesting.

683
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,500
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.

684
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,770
- Really?
- Yeah, Father Lilliman.

685
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:49,780
- Lilliman.
- Was paid almost 200 grand a month.

686
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,180
Now, that is interesting.

687
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,750
Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.

688
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,130
- Your Grace.
- Oh, Denis.

689
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,990
- Has everything been arranged?
- Yes.

690
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,290
I've just received your
interlink itinerary.

691
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,330
You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.

692
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,990
You're most diligent, Denis...

693
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:15,130
a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our Lord, but...

694
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,870
- Your Grace?
- It wasn't labor I was speaking of.

695
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:21,070
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.

696
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,480
My last little joy.

697
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,410
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

698
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,920
She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.

699
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,320
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.

700
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,890
Older?

701
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,220
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?

702
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,630
That is for Your Grace to decide.

703
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,410
- Oh, my.
- Your Grace.

704
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:01,010
To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.

705
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,620
Mea culpa, my child.

706
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,050
Mea culpa.

707
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,100
Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.

708
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:20,300
A confession?
I love the confessional game.

709
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,370
Tell me your sins.

710
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,370
This isn't a game, Your Grace.

711
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,840
Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.

712
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,780
- I'm sorry?
- I'm telling you this...

713
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:31,510
because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.

714
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:35,350
I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.

715
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,620
- I think this should balance it out.
- What are you talking about?

716
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,660
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm...

717
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,020
I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.

718
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,500
I'm telling you that any moment,
he's going to come through that door.

719
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,030
I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.

720
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,500
Wonderful!

721
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,970
It's a game I've never played!

722
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:00,100
What a delightful mind you have. I hope
the rest of you is just as interesting.

723
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,550
- No, please, you have to believe me.
- Oh, I do, I do, I do.

724
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,810
Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.

725
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,420
Stop it! Get off of me!

726
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,710
Seems I've captured
a dangerous terrorist.

727
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,980
Now, how best to procure
her confession?

728
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,060
You little bitch. You fucking little whore!

729
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,590
- Reverend.
- Oh, my God.

730
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,460
She wasn't lying. It is you.

731
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,660
I'm sorry.

732
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,530
- I had to.
- Evey!

733
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,440
And thus I clothe my naked villainy...

734
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,640
with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ...

735
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,950
and seem a saint,
when most I play the devil.

736
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,090
Oh, please, have mercy.

737
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,190
Oh, not tonight, Bishop.

738
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,050
Not tonight.

739
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,150
Don't do this, I beg of you.

740
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,490
Well, then. Childrens hour at the abbey.

741
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,660
Open your mouth
and stick out your tongue.

742
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,170
- What the...?
- I don't want to die!

743
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,600
This is Surveillance 109.
We have an emergency.

744
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:09,080
Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.

745
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,910
- Tonight.
- Yes, sir.

746
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,650
Pucker up, here comes the Finger.

747
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:17,120
Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.

748
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:23,260
Creedy.

749
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,790
What are you doing here?

750
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:29,830
Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.

751
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,240
This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.

752
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:37,210
The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.

753
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,400
It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.

754
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,780
The security of information
is paramount.

755
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,790
In these volatile times...

756
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:48,790
mistakes like Jordan Tower
can no longer be tolerated...

757
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,320
if, indeed,
Jordan Tower was an accident.

758
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,760
- What does that mean?
- Terrorist seems to have...

759
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,520
a rather intimate understanding
of our system.

760
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,500
The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.

761
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,200
Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?

762
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:04,130
At this time, it would behoove you...

763
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:09,300
to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed...

764
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,880
and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.

765
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,840
You mean Larkhill?

766
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,580
Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.

767
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:22,020
- His loyalty is not in question.
- But mine is?

768
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,120
Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?

769
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,920
Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?

770
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,800
I've been a party member for 27 years.

771
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,270
If I were you, chief inspector...

772
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,600
I'd find the terrorist...

773
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,740
and I'd find him soon.

774
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,600
Please.

775
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,910
Evey? Good God!

776
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,610
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go.

777
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:59,580
Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.

778
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,730
- Cheers.
- I know every cop's looking for me.

779
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,570
I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.

780
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,140
- Evey...
- You could be in terrible trouble.

781
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:17,800
Evey, listen to me.

782
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,850
If the government ever searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.

783
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,680
You trusted me.

784
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:30,910
It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.

785
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,700
Oh, my God.
That's God Save the Queen.

786
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,570
My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.

787
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,800
- I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
- He believes he did.

788
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,780
Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel...

789
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:58,780
it always cheers me up.

790
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,950
- What is that?
- It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.

791
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,290
- Are you a Muslim?
- No, I'm in television.

792
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:09,490
But why would you keep it?

793
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,890
I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful, poetry moving.

794
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,030
Is it worth it?
If they found that here...

795
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,500
I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.

796
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,110
Thank you, Gordon.

797
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:22,400
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.

798
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,030
This whole thing started the night
he blew up the Old Bailey.

799
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:28,410
I was on my way here, and...

800
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,680
Yes.

801
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:37,410
You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.

802
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:39,720
- But...
- You're wondering why...

803
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,450
you were invited here to supper
in the first place...

804
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:46,690
if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.

805
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:50,430
Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain...

806
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,200
young and attractive ladies
like yourself.

807
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:57,170
Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired...

808
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:01,300
I would undoubtedly find myself without
a home, let alone a television show.

809
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,450
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.

810
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,650
The truth is, after so many years...

811
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,260
you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.

812
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:15,450
You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.

813
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,260
I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.

814
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,460
You could get these poisons
from any house in London.

815
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,200
Thanks, Delia.

816
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:31,380
Any leads on finding this guy?

817
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:34,880
Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.

818
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:40,680
You started as a botanist, didn't you?

819
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,560
It's... It's a Scarlet Carson.

820
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,390
They're believed to be extinct.

821
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,490
He leaves them at the crime scenes.

822
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,360
I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.

823
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:57,090
Any information could be helpful.

824
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,430
Of course.

825
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,240
Excuse me.

826
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:04,200
Yeah?

827
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,640
I just finished going through the file,
inspector. You better get back here.

828
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,280
Yeah, okay.

829
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:15,150
- My God. He's killed them all.
- All but one.

830
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,780
- Who is she?
- Not sure.

831
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,520
She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.

832
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:25,190
But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.

833
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:27,960
Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.

834
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:30,000
Running away?

835
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:34,330
Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.

836
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:36,910
- She changed her name.
- That's what I'm guessing.

837
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,140
I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.

838
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:43,650
- It's late, or early.
- Call them again. I want that name.

839
00:53:43,675 --> 00:53:46,675
SharePirate.Com - Convenient Downloads for Members

840
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:57,430
What? Are you sure about that?

841
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,330
Okay. Thank you.

842
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,700
Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.

843
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,130
- The coroner?
- Yeah.

844
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,410
Jesus, I just saw her.

845
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,280
It's you, isn't it?

846
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,010
- You've come to kill me.
- Yes.

847
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,390
Thank God.

848
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm sorry, I can't get a response
from that number.

849
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,100
There's a problem with the connection.

850
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,100
Jesus Christ.

851
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,070
He's there.

852
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,540
After what happened,
after what they did...

853
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,030
I thought about killing myself.

854
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,410
But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.

855
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,910
I didn't know what
they were going to do.

856
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,310
I swear to you.

857
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,120
Read my journal.

858
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:00,520
What they did was only possible
because of you.

859
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:05,990
Oppeneimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.

860
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,000
He changed the entire course
of human history.

861
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,830
Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?

862
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,170
I have not come
for what you hoped to do.

863
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,210
I've come for what you did.

864
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,010
It's funny.

865
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,010
I was given one of your roses today.

866
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:28,480
I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.

867
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,320
What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.

868
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,990
There are no coincidences, Delia.

869
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,130
Only the illusion of coincidence.

870
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,290
I have another rose.

871
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,840
And this one is for you.

872
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:56,350
- You're going to kill me now?
- I killed you 10 minutes ago...

873
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,910
while you slept.

874
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:02,650
- Is there any pain?
- No.

875
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,290
Thank you.

876
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,820
Is it meaningless to apologize?

877
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,360
Never.

878
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,530
I'm so sorry.

879
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,890
Damn it.

880
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:43,230
The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.

881
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,960
He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.

882
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:50,160
Am I to understand that you have read
this document, inspector?

883
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:52,430
- Yes, sir.
- Has anyone else read it?

884
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,028
No, sir.

885
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:55,470
Then let me make this
perfectly clear to you.

886
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,130
The contents of this document
are a matter of national security...

887
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:03,180
constituting an assault on the character
of several important party members...

888
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:06,820
as well as a blatant violation
of the Articles of Allegiance.

889
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,890
As the authenticity of this document
cannot be verified...

890
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,890
it could be an elaborate forgery
created by the terrorist...

891
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:17,760
as easily as it could be the deranged
fantasy of a former party member...

892
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,090
who resigned
for psychological reasons.

893
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,160
Any discussion of this document
or its contents...

894
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,270
will be regarded, at the very least,
as an act of sedition...

895
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,910
if not a willful act of treason.

896
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,410
- Is that understood, Mr. Finch?
- Yes, sir.

897
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:35,280
You would do well, inspector...

898
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:37,850
to put it out of your mind.

899
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,760
May 23rd.

900
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:53,000
My first batch of subjects arrived today...

901
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:56,900
and I have to admit
that I'm very excited.

902
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,870
This could be the dawn of a new age.

903
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,810
Nuclear power is meaningless...

904
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,950
in a world where a virus
can kill an entire population...

905
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,170
and leave its wealth intact.

906
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:14,480
- Stay together!
- Come on, move!

907
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,950
May 27th.

908
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,250
Commander Prothero toured the lab
with a priest, Father Lilliman...

909
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:24,260
who I was told is here to monitor
for Rules and Rights violations.

910
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:28,700
It made me nervous, but the commander
assured me there wouldn't be a problem.

911
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,730
June 2nd.

912
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:35,100
I keep wondering if these people knew
how they might be helping their country...

913
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,610
if they would act any differently.

914
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:41,710
They're so weak and pathetic.
They never look you in the eye.

915
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,350
I find myself hating them.

916
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:49,390
August the 18th.

917
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,320
Of the original four dozen,
over 75 percent are now deceased.

918
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:59,090
No controllable pattern has yet emerged.

919
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,600
September the 18th.

920
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:05,830
There is one case that continues
to give me hope.

921
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:10,670
He exhibits none of the immune-system
pathologies the other subjects developed.

922
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:15,340
I've discovered cellular anomalies in his
blood that I've been unable to categorize.

923
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,350
The mutations seem to have triggered...

924
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,480
the abnormal development
of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.

925
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,820
The subject said
he could no longer remember...

926
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:26,720
who he was or where he was from.

927
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:30,660
Whoever he was,
he is now the key to our dream...

928
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:34,360
and the hope that all of this
will not have been in vain.

929
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,130
November the 5th.

930
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,770
It started last night, around midnight.

931
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:46,810
The first explosions tore open
the entire medical section.

932
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:50,810
All my work, gone.

933
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:55,010
I was trying to understand how
it could've happened when I saw him.

934
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:57,420
The man from room 5.

935
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:58,820
He looked at me.

936
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:02,430
Not with eyes. There were no eyes.

937
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,120
But I know he was looking at me
because I felt it.

938
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:16,600
Oh, God... what have I done?

939
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,170
What is that you're making?

940
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,870
We called it "eggie in the basket."
My mum made them.

941
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,880
- This is weird.
- What?

942
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:58,510
The first morning I was with him,
he made me eggs just like this.

943
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,980
- Really?
- I swear.

944
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:05,920
That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.

945
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:08,030
- There is?
- Yes, Evey.

946
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,020
I am V.

947
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,660
At last you know the truth.

948
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,530
You're stunned, I know.

949
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:17,330
Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior...

950
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:22,700
there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.

951
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:26,010
That is not funny, Gordon.

952
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,840
Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.

953
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:31,580
I've seen people go to jail
for less than that.

954
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,650
Of course, he was right, wasn't he?

955
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:37,190
There is something wrong
with this country.

956
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,760
Morning, inspector.

957
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:58,270
You're at it early.

958
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:03,510
Is something wrong?
You don't look so good, sir.

959
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:14,280
I wanna ask a question, Dominic.

960
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,030
I don't care if you answer me or not.

961
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,190
I just wanna say this aloud.

962
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:26,230
But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.

963
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,700
Yeah, of course, inspector, but...

964
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:31,210
Because of the terrorist?

965
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,010
No.

966
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:38,280
So, what is it, chief? What's going on?

967
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:44,550
The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's...

968
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:46,860
and Three Waters.

969
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:53,430
The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours...

970
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,400
the question I have to ask, is:

971
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,800
What if the worst...

972
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:05,070
the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history...

973
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:09,010
was not the work
of religious extremists?

974
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:12,850
Well, I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.

975
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,150
And they were executed. I know.

976
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,310
And maybe that's really what happened.

977
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:23,250
But I see this chain of events...

978
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,290
these coincidences,
and I have to ask:

979
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:33,060
What if that isn't what happened?
What if someone else unleashed that virus?

980
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,300
What if someone else
killed all those people?

981
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,770
Would you really wanna know
who it was?

982
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,210
Sure.

983
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,710
Even if it was someone
working for this government?

984
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:48,210
That's my question.

985
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:51,450
If our own government was responsible...

986
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:55,920
for what happened at St. Mary's
and Three Waters...

987
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:04,270
if our own government was responsible
for the deaths of almost 100,000 people...

988
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,900
would you really wanna know?

989
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:11,540
This has to be the bloody coldest
March in years.

990
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,110
Keep talking like that,
we'll lose our party status.

991
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,133
They're a pack of
lying, greedy hypocrites!

992
01:04:16,146 --> 01:04:18,010
Keep it down, will you?

993
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,150
Based on random audio sweeps,
I've projected that right now...

994
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:28,560
80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive.

995
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,490
We're also showing
a 12-percent increase...

996
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:35,120
over last month's positive mention
in all four quadrants.

997
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,790
- Mr. Creedy?
- We're handling it as best we can.

998
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:41,630
Arrests are as high as they've been
since the Reclamation.

999
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:44,280
I want more than arrests. I want results.

1000
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,670
- What's all this about?
- I'm celebrating.

1001
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,980
Celebrating what?

1002
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:56,180
I think this could be
the best show we've ever done.

1003
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,150
Very good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1004
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:02,620
Listen, we've got an extraordinary
show for you tonight.

1005
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:06,190
You're not gonna believe it.
As a matter of fact, I don't think I do.

1006
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,860
Will you please give
a very warm welcome...

1007
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,440
to our own Chancellor Adam Sutler!

1008
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,500
- No way!
- No, it can't be!

1009
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:23,870
We threw out the censor-approved script
and shot one I wrote this morning.

1010
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,640
Oh, my God.

1011
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,930
Chancellor, chancellor, chancellor...

1012
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,930
I understand you've been under
tremendous strain lately...

1013
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,230
since the beginning
of this whole terrorism business...

1014
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:50,500
and we thought it would be a nice idea
to try and help you relax. Girls?

1015
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,950
Warm milk. There's nothing better.

1016
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:03,150
I understand you enjoy a glass
every night, chancellor.

1017
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,120
Since I was a boy.

1018
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:07,780
But you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich.

1019
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,913
The terrorist was never
a serious concern.

1020
01:06:09,926 --> 01:06:11,810
Oh, really?

1021
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,210
- Chancellor, chancellor...
- It's him.

1022
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,610
Are you saying that he's not still alive
and active?

1023
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:20,450
The terrorist has been neutralized.

1024
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,820
Oh, my God! Chancellor, look!

1025
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:26,620
The terrorist!

1026
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,720
The terrorist!

1027
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:32,160
Get him!

1028
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,700
Oh, dear.

1029
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,480
At last!

1030
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:01,600
And now, for all the world to see.

1031
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,990
It's him!

1032
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:09,160
Unhand me! I am your chancellor!

1033
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:13,040
How dare you! I am the chancellor!

1034
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:15,280
Imposter!

1035
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,910
Soldiers! That man is the terrorist!

1036
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:27,020
- I order you to shoot that traitor!
- Liar!

1037
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:28,210
- Faker!
- Fraud!

1038
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:30,260
- Ready!
- Aim!

1039
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:31,890
- Fire!
- Fire!

1040
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:45,760
What are they gonna do, fine us?

1041
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:49,400
Big deal. We've got
the most-watched show on air.

1042
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:52,070
Well, you're my agent,
that's what I pay you for.

1043
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:54,110
Protect me.

1044
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,110
I should've hired him
to be my mother.

1045
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:59,050
- You're mad.
- Either that or I wasn't breast-fed.

1046
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:02,210
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Only the things that matter.

1047
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:05,620
- What if they come after you?
- I tell you what's gonna happen.

1048
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,990
I'll have to make some kind of apology,
do some boring fundraiser.

1049
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:14,230
In the meantime, our ratings will go
through the roof. It'll be fine. Trust me.

1050
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:22,850
Gordon?

1051
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:27,120
Quick, Evey, hide!

1052
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,440
Not so funny now, is it, funnyman?

1053
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,450
- Gotcha.
- No, no.

1054
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,040
Do you know why you're here,
Evey Hammond?

1055
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:56,540
Please.

1056
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,120
You've been charged
with three counts of murder...

1057
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:03,140
the bombing of government property,
conspiracy to commit terrorism...

1058
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:08,220
treason and sedition, the penalty
for which is death by firing squad.

1059
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:14,830
You have one chance,
and only one chance, to save your life.

1060
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,960
You must tell us the identity
or whereabouts...

1061
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,000
of code name V.

1062
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:24,300
If your information leads
to his capture...

1063
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,280
you will be released
from this facility immediately.

1064
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:31,040
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

1065
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:34,310
You can return to your life,
Miss Hammond.

1066
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:38,820
All you have to do is cooperate.

1067
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,820
Process her.

1068
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:55,290
I know there's no way I can convince you
this is not one of their tricks...

1069
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:56,860
but I don't care.

1070
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:58,830
I am me.

1071
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,730
My name is Valerie.

1072
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:05,930
I don't think I'll live much longer,
and I wanted to tell someone about my life.

1073
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:10,510
This is the only autobiography
that I will ever write and, God...

1074
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:13,410
I'm writing it on toilet paper.

1075
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:19,080
I was born in Nottingham in 1985.

1076
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:24,050
I don't remember much of those early years,
but I do remember the rain.

1077
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,690
My grandmother owned a farm
in Tottle Brook...

1078
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:29,730
and she used to tell me
that God was in the rain.

1079
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:32,660
I passed my 11 Plus
and went to girls' grammar.

1080
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:35,560
It was at school
that I met my first girlfriend.

1081
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:37,330
Her name was Sarah.

1082
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:39,530
It was her wrists.

1083
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:41,330
They were beautiful.

1084
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:46,270
I thought we would
love each other forever.

1085
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:49,140
I remember our teacher telling us...

1086
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:52,010
that it was an adolescent phase
that people outgrew.

1087
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,740
Sarah did.

1088
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:57,120
I didn't.

1089
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:01,450
In 2002, I fell in love
with a girl named Christina.

1090
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:03,820
That year I came out to my parents.

1091
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,660
I couldn't have done it
without Chris holding my hand.

1092
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:13,000
My father wouldn't look at me.
He told me to go and never come back.

1093
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:14,830
My mother said nothing.

1094
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:19,730
But I'd only told them the truth.
Was that so selfish?

1095
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:24,710
Our integrity sells for so little,
but it is all we really have.

1096
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,040
It is the very last inch of us.

1097
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:31,180
But within that inch...
we are free.

1098
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:35,520
It ends whenever you want it to.

1099
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:38,290
- Just tell us where he is.
- I don't know.

1100
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:17,370
I'd always known
what I wanted to do with my life...

1101
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:22,730
and in 2015 I starred in my first film,
The Salt Flats.

1102
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,700
It was the most important role of my life.
Not because of my career...

1103
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,870
but because that was how I met Ruth.

1104
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:33,810
The first time we kissed...

1105
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:38,750
I knew I never wanted to kiss
any other lips but hers again.

1106
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,030
We moved to a small flat
in London together.

1107
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,720
She grew Scarlet Carsons for me
in our window box...

1108
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:54,470
and our place always smelt of roses.

1109
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:58,970
Those were the best years of my life.

1110
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:07,120
But America's war grew worse and worse,
and eventually came to London.

1111
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:10,410
The bill proposed by the Undersecretary
for Defense, Adam Sutler...

1112
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:13,520
to close the remaining tube stations
passed with...

1113
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:16,520
After that, there were no roses anymore.

1114
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:18,430
Not for anyone.

1115
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,690
You won't last much longer.

1116
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:22,530
You're gonna die here.

1117
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,760
Why protect someone
who doesn't give a shit about you?

1118
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:39,980
I remember how the meaning of words
began to change.

1119
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:46,680
How unfamiliar words like "collateral"
and "rendition" became frightening...

1120
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:52,130
while things like "Norsefire" and the
"Articles of Allegiance" became powerful.

1121
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,020
I remember how "different"
became dangerous.

1122
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,730
I still don't understand it...

1123
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,960
why they hate us so much.

1124
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:09,410
They took Ruth
while she was out buying food.

1125
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,710
I've never cried so hard in my life.

1126
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,480
It wasn't long till they came for me.

1127
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:30,320
It seems strange that my life should end
in such a terrible place.

1128
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:35,910
But for three years,
I had roses and apologized to no one.

1129
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:40,340
I shall die here.

1130
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:44,040
Every inch of me shall perish.

1131
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,910
Every inch...

1132
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,780
but one.

1133
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,580
An inch.

1134
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,920
It is small, and it is fragile...

1135
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,790
and it is the only thing
in the world worth having.

1136
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:06,060
We must never lose it or give it away.
We must never let them take it from us.

1137
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:11,210
I hope that, whoever you are,
you escape this place.

1138
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:14,570
I hope that the world turns
and that things get better.

1139
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,680
But what I hope most of all
is that you understand what I mean...

1140
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:23,050
when I tell you that
even though I do not know you...

1141
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:25,950
and even though
I may never meet you...

1142
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:29,390
laugh with you, cry with you...

1143
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,490
or kiss you...

1144
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:33,760
I love you.

1145
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:36,460
With all my heart...

1146
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:38,670
I love you.

1147
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:41,740
Valerie.

1148
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:59,190
I'm instructed to inform you that you
have been convicted by special tribunal...

1149
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:04,320
and that unless you are ready to offer
your cooperation, you are to be executed.

1150
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:08,260
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

1151
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:12,100
- Yes.
- Are you ready to cooperate?

1152
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:18,170
- No.
- Very well.

1153
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:23,010
Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell.

1154
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:25,640
Arrange a detail of six men...

1155
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:28,790
and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her.

1156
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:46,030
It's time.

1157
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:49,140
I'm ready.

1158
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:53,570
Look, all they want
is one little piece of information.

1159
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,010
Just give them something, anything.

1160
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:58,380
Thank you...

1161
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:01,540
but I'd rather die
behind the chemical sheds.

1162
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:06,020
Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.

1163
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:13,360
What?

1164
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:39,110
Hello, Evey.

1165
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:41,950
You.

1166
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,950
- It was you?
- Yeah.

1167
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,050
That wasn't real?

1168
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:55,490
- Is Gordon...?
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Deitrich's dead.

1169
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,100
I thought they'd arrest him...

1170
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:00,530
but when they found a Koran
in his house, they had him executed.

1171
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:02,700
Oh, God.

1172
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:05,143
Fortunately, I got to
you before they did.

1173
01:22:05,156 --> 01:22:06,940
You got to me?

1174
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,510
You did this to me?

1175
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,550
You cut my hair?

1176
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:16,480
You tortured me?

1177
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,150
You tortured me.

1178
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:21,920
Why?

1179
01:22:23,090 --> 01:22:27,530
You said you wanted to live without fear.
I wish there'd been an easier way...

1180
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,760
but there wasn't. Oh, my God.

1181
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:31,830
I know you may never forgive me...

1182
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,070
but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me.

1183
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:38,300
Every day, I saw in myself
everything you see in me now.

1184
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:40,870
Every day, I wanted to end it.

1185
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:44,640
But each time you refused to give in,
I knew I couldn't.

1186
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:47,550
You're sick! You're evil!

1187
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:51,180
You could have ended it.
You could have given in, but you didn't.

1188
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:54,320
- Why?
- Leave me alone! I hate you!

1189
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:58,050
That's it! See, at first,
I thought it was hate too.

1190
01:22:58,230 --> 01:23:00,790
Hate was all I knew.
It built my world, imprisoned me...

1191
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:03,460
taught me how to eat,
how to drink, how to breathe.

1192
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:07,200
I thought I'd die
with all the hate in my veins.

1193
01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:09,310
But then something happened.

1194
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:11,870
It happened to me
just as it happened to you.

1195
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,910
Shut up! I don't want to hear your lies!

1196
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,850
Your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth.

1197
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:20,780
Yes, I created a lie.

1198
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:24,550
But because you believed it,
you found something true about yourself.

1199
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:28,120
- No.
- What was true in that cell is true now.

1200
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:31,350
What you felt in there
has nothing to do with me.

1201
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:34,120
I can't feel anything anymore!

1202
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:38,030
Don't run from it, Evey.
You've been running all your life.

1203
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,000
I can't... Can't breathe.

1204
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:45,870
Asthma. When I was little...

1205
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:49,540
Listen to me, Evey.

1206
01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:53,310
This may be the most important moment
of your life. Commit to it.

1207
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:58,910
They took your parents from you.
They took your brother from you.

1208
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:04,950
They put you in a cell and took everything
they could take except your life.

1209
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:08,030
And you believed that was all
there was, didn't you?

1210
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,930
The only thing you had left
was your life, but it wasn't.

1211
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:14,770
- Oh, please.
- You found something else.

1212
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:18,770
In that cell, you found something
that mattered more to you than life.

1213
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:22,280
When they threatened to kill you
unless you gave what they wanted...

1214
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:25,310
you told them you'd rather die.

1215
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,410
You faced your death, Evey.

1216
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:30,550
You were calm. You were still.

1217
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,120
Try to feel now what you felt then.

1218
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,260
Oh, God.

1219
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:45,100
I felt...

1220
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:47,200
Yes?

1221
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:50,970
I'm dizzy.

1222
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:53,240
I need air.

1223
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:56,640
Please, I need to be outside.

1224
01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:58,870
There's a lift.
It'll take us to the roof.

1225
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:18,940
God is in the rain.

1226
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:25,130
V.

1227
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:27,640
I'm leaving.

1228
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:33,640
There are 872 songs in here.

1229
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:37,710
I've listened to them all,
but I've never danced to any of them.

1230
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:41,010
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

1231
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:42,650
I can't stay here.

1232
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:45,710
I know.

1233
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:50,430
Well, you won't find
any more locked doors here.

1234
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,560
I thought about keeping this...

1235
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:57,220
but it didn't seem right,
knowing you wrote it.

1236
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:04,670
I didn't.

1237
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:08,900
May I show you something
before you go?

1238
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:22,250
- She was real.
- Yes.

1239
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:24,160
She's beautiful.

1240
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:27,460
- Did you know her?
- No.

1241
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:30,300
She wrote the letter
just before she died.

1242
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:33,330
And I delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me.

1243
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:35,430
Then it really happened, didn't it?

1244
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:38,670
- Yes.
- You were in the cell next to her.

1245
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:43,870
And that's what this is all about.

1246
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:47,140
You're getting back at them
for what they did to her.

1247
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:51,020
- And to you.
- What was done to me created me.

1248
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:53,090
It's a basic principle of the universe...

1249
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:56,190
that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction.

1250
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,760
Is that how you see it?

1251
01:27:57,930 --> 01:28:00,400
- Like an equation?
- What was done to me was monstrous.

1252
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,620
And they created a monster.

1253
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:16,300
- Do you know where you'll go?
- No.

1254
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:19,980
That would have scared me before...

1255
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:21,850
but I suppose I should thank you.

1256
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:35,060
Thank you.

1257
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,190
Goodbye.

1258
01:28:41,370 --> 01:28:43,070
Evey...

1259
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:47,040
may I ask you for something?

1260
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:52,010
If I had one wish, I would wish
to see you again, if only once...

1261
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:53,910
before the 5th.

1262
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:58,820
- All right.
- Thank you.

1263
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:23,780
Chancellor, I know no one seems
to want to discuss this...

1264
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:26,380
but if we're to be prepared
for any eventuality...

1265
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:29,450
then it can't be ignored any longer.

1266
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:34,150
The red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists.

1267
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:35,760
Now, it concludes that...

1268
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:39,330
the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use...

1269
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,900
would be an airborne attack.

1270
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:43,690
A separate report has been filed...

1271
01:29:43,870 --> 01:29:47,700
suggesting a train, despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding Parliament...

1272
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:49,430
have been sealed shut.

1273
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:51,570
Who filed that report?

1274
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,300
Chief Inspector Finch.

1275
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,380
Do you have any evidence
to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch?

1276
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:00,110
No, sir. Just a feeling.

1277
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,250
If I am sure of anything, inspector...

1278
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:06,580
it is that this government will not survive
if it is to be subject to your feelings.

1279
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:09,690
Mr. Dascomb,
what we need right now...

1280
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:12,920
is a clear message
to the people of this country.

1281
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:15,430
This message must be read
in every newspaper...

1282
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,120
heard on every radio,
seen on every television.

1283
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:22,330
This message must resound
throughout the entire interlink!

1284
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:25,910
I want this country to realize
that we stand on the edge of oblivion.

1285
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:30,340
I want every man, woman and child
to understand how close we are to chaos.

1286
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:32,450
I want everyone...

1287
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:36,350
to remember why they need us!

1288
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:41,050
In the former United States, civil war
continues to devastate the Midwest.

1289
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:45,530
Scientists attribute this water shortage
to the lack of rainfall the last two years.

1290
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:48,820
Ministry officials expect
water coupon prices to rise.

1291
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:50,970
Police have arrested nine suspects...

1292
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:54,900
Can you believe this shit?
Been going on all summer.

1293
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:59,030
Outside the quarantine zone, a new
airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.

1294
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:03,540
Authorities uncovered new evidence linking
the terrorist organization called V...

1295
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:08,020
to the St. Mary's viral attack
on London 14 years ago.

1296
01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:22,560
My friend inside the Finger
came up with something.

1297
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,630
There were three men.

1298
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,600
Covert intel.

1299
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:29,030
Original black-baggers, all under Creedy.

1300
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:33,910
Alan Percy, Robert Keyes,
William Rookwood.

1301
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,170
The day after
the St. Mary's outbreak...

1302
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:39,750
Percy gives his Beretta a blowjob,
Keyes dies in a fire...

1303
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,410
Rookwood goes missing.

1304
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:44,520
Bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach.

1305
01:31:44,690 --> 01:31:46,450
Rookwood.

1306
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,450
How do I know that name?

1307
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:58,660
Shit. He must have had a hidden trip
on his file at the Finger.

1308
01:31:58,870 --> 01:32:01,100
But how'd he know it was you?

1309
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:04,230
What do we do?

1310
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:08,240
I'm a cop. I have to know.

1311
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:20,050
I came when they opened it.
It gave me the collywobbles.

1312
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:23,350
Still does.

1313
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,600
That's close enough, inspector.

1314
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:38,400
We're not wired.

1315
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:42,940
I'm sorry, but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution.

1316
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:46,380
- You have information for us?
- No, you already have the information.

1317
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:48,610
All the names and dates
are inside your head.

1318
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:51,250
What you want,
what you really need, is a story.

1319
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:53,410
A story can be true or false.

1320
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:57,120
I leave such judgments to you, inspector.

1321
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:01,400
Our story begins,
as these stories often do...

1322
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:04,690
with a young,
up-and-coming politician.

1323
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:08,830
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.

1324
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:13,380
He's completely single-minded and has
no regard for the political process.

1325
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:16,710
The more power he attains,
the more obvious his zealotry...

1326
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,470
and the more aggressive
his supporters become.

1327
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:25,480
Eventually, his party launches a special
project in the name of national security.

1328
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:29,060
At first it's believed to be a search
for biological weapons...

1329
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:31,990
and it's pursued without regard
to its cost.

1330
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:35,890
However, the true goal
of this project is power.

1331
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:38,830
Complete and total
hegemonic domination.

1332
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,560
The project, however, ends violently.

1333
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:45,530
But the efforts of those involved
are not in vain...

1334
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:50,740
for a new ability to wage war is born
from the blood of one of the victims.

1335
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:54,510
Imagine a virus,
the most terrifying virus you can...

1336
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:57,710
and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure.

1337
01:33:57,890 --> 01:34:02,790
But if your ultimate goal is power,
how best to use such a weapon?

1338
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:06,590
Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.

1339
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,260
A man seemingly
without a conscience...

1340
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:11,700
for whom the ends
always justify the means.

1341
01:34:11,870 --> 01:34:15,460
He suggests that their target
should not be an enemy of the country...

1342
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,500
but rather, the country itself.

1343
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,910
Three targets are chosen
to maximize the effect of the attack:

1344
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,070
A school, a tube station
and a water-treatment plant.

1345
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:26,840
Several hundred die
within the first few weeks.

1346
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:29,350
Three Waters has, in fact,
been contaminated.

1347
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:32,180
Authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread.

1348
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,350
Sent destruction
through the Underground.

1349
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:38,390
Fueled by the media,
fear and panic spread quickly...

1350
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:43,800
fracturing and dividing the country until,
at last, the true goal comes into view.

1351
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:45,400
Before the St. Mary's crises...

1352
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:49,770
no one would have predicted the results
of the election that year. No one.

1353
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:54,400
And then not long after the election,
lo and behold, a miracle.

1354
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:57,100
Some believed it was the work
of God himself.

1355
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:01,050
But it was a pharmaceutical company
controlled by certain party members...

1356
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:04,450
that made them all obscenely rich.

1357
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:08,790
A year later, several extremists are tried,
found guilty and executed...

1358
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:12,260
while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims.

1359
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:18,060
But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.

1360
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,570
Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.

1361
01:35:20,740 --> 01:35:23,370
Through it, our politician
was ultimately appointed...

1362
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:27,500
to the newly created position
of high chancellor.

1363
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,270
The rest, as they say, is history.

1364
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:36,350
- Can you prove any of this?
- Why do you think I'm still alive?

1365
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:42,860
All right. We'd like to take you into
protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.

1366
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:44,890
I'm sure you would.

1367
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:49,970
But if you want that recording,
you'll do what I tell you to do.

1368
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:53,100
Put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.

1369
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:56,140
When I feel safe he can't pick his nose
without you knowing...

1370
01:35:56,310 --> 01:35:57,770
I'll contact you again.

1371
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:00,210
Till then, cheerio.

1372
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,210
Rookwood...

1373
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,710
why didn't you come forward before?

1374
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:09,150
What were you waiting for?

1375
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,510
Well, for you, inspector.

1376
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:13,490
I needed you.

1377
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,840
What's he doing in the dark there?

1378
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:45,540
Creepy Creedy. Not sure I wanna know.

1379
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:49,320
Sutler can no longer trust you,
can he, Mr. Creedy?

1380
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:51,650
And we both know why.

1381
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:54,700
After I destroy Parliament...

1382
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:58,770
his only chance will be to offer them
someone else, some other piece of meat.

1383
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:00,160
And who will that be?

1384
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,570
You, Mr. Creedy.

1385
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:06,230
A man as smart as you
has probably considered this.

1386
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:10,210
A man as smart as you
probably has a plan.

1387
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:13,540
That plan is the reason
Sutler no longer trusts you.

1388
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:16,210
It's the reason why
you're being watched right now...

1389
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:19,180
why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house...

1390
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,920
and a tap on every phone.
Bollocks.

1391
01:37:22,090 --> 01:37:26,530
Oh, a man as smart as you, I think,
knows otherwise.

1392
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:29,690
- What do you want?
- Sutler.

1393
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:33,860
Come, now, Mr. Creedy,
you knew this was coming.

1394
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:36,030
You knew that one day
it'd be you or him.

1395
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:39,540
That's why Sutler's been kept
underground for security purposes.

1396
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:42,870
That's why there are several
of your men close to Sutler...

1397
01:37:43,050 --> 01:37:46,850
men that can be counted on.
All you have to do is say the word.

1398
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:49,920
- What do I get out of this deal?
- Me.

1399
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,920
If you accept,
put an X on your front door.

1400
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:58,960
Why should I trust you?

1401
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:02,330
Because it's the only way
you're ever going to stop me.

1402
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:13,770
It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.

1403
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:16,980
May we come up?

1404
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:20,580
You find your own tree.

1405
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:34,490
We got Creepy pinned
like a butterfly for weeks.

1406
01:38:35,170 --> 01:38:37,530
Still no word. What's he waiting for?

1407
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:43,140
Yeah? Inspector, it's for you.

1408
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:47,780
- Yeah.
- Is that Chief Inspector Finch?

1409
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:49,740
- It is.
- This is Captain Clark...

1410
01:38:49,910 --> 01:38:52,010
of the 137th Ward at South end.

1411
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:53,410
- We found him.
- Found who?

1412
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:55,640
William Rookwood,
the one you're looking for.

1413
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:59,620
I saw your report a couple weeks back,
thought I'd run it through our John Does.

1414
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:01,690
I hooked him. Perfect dental match.

1415
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:05,790
A floater. Fishermen picked him up.
No ID, never solved. Till now, that is.

1416
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:09,730
- William Rookwood is dead?
- I'd say so. Twenty years now.

1417
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:14,460
Goddamn it!

1418
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:17,140
That son of a bitch sat there...

1419
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:21,000
and spoon-fed me that bullshit,
and I ate it up!

1420
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:23,850
So, what do we do now, inspector?

1421
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:26,380
We do what we should have been doing.

1422
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:28,480
We find him.

1423
01:39:50,210 --> 01:39:53,110
Every day, gentlemen.

1424
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:57,300
Every day that brings us closer
to November...

1425
01:39:57,480 --> 01:40:00,210
every day that man remains free...

1426
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:03,080
is one more failure.

1427
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:05,690
Three hundred and forty-seven days,
gentlemen.

1428
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:08,260
Three hundred and forty-seven failures!

1429
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:11,120
Chancellor, we do not have
the adequate force...

1430
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:17,260
We are being buried beneath the avalanche
of your inadequacies, Mr. Creedy!

1431
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:35,980
I'll get it.

1432
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:39,650
- Eric Finch?
- Yeah.

1433
01:40:44,530 --> 01:40:45,760
Bloody hell.

1434
01:40:47,530 --> 01:40:49,160
How many went out?

1435
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:51,030
So far we count eight boxcars.

1436
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:54,000
- Several hundred thousand, at least.
- Christ.

1437
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:59,630
I want anyone caught
with one of those masks arrested!

1438
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:02,610
Give me the money!
Give me the fucking money!

1439
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:05,770
We're under siege here.
The whole city's gone mad.

1440
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,920
- This is exactly what he wants.
- What?

1441
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:12,780
- Anarchy in the UK!
- Chaos.

1442
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:18,190
Mr. Creedy, I am holding you
personally responsible for this situation.

1443
01:41:20,630 --> 01:41:25,030
The problem is that he knows us
better than we know ourselves.

1444
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:29,930
That's why I went to Larkhill
last night.

1445
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:33,540
- That's outside quarantine.
- I had to see it.

1446
01:41:35,210 --> 01:41:36,840
There wasn't much left.

1447
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:40,980
But when I was there, it was strange.

1448
01:41:41,150 --> 01:41:44,810
I suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected.

1449
01:41:50,490 --> 01:41:52,120
Like I could see the whole thing.

1450
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:57,330
One long chain of events that stretched
all the way back before Larkhill.

1451
01:41:59,370 --> 01:42:02,700
I felt like I could see everything
that had happened...

1452
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:10,810
and everything that
was going to happen.

1453
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:13,010
Hey, you!

1454
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:19,350
It was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me...

1455
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:23,180
and I realized that
we were all a part of it...

1456
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,590
and all trapped by it.

1457
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:38,840
So do you know what's gonna happen?

1458
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:42,700
No. It was a feeling.

1459
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:46,340
But I can guess.

1460
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,850
With so much chaos,
someone will do something stupid.

1461
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:59,860
And when they do...
things will turn nasty.

1462
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,170
Rioters were arrested in Brixton.

1463
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:20,820
And then Sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do.

1464
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:29,320
At which point,
all V needs to do is keep his word.

1465
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:31,920
And then...

1466
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,790
Tonight's your big night.

1467
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:41,490
You ready for it?

1468
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:45,890
Are we ready for it?

1469
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:20,760
I missed this song.

1470
01:45:21,670 --> 01:45:23,730
I didn't think you'd come.

1471
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:26,240
I said I would.

1472
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:31,770
You look well.

1473
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:33,380
Thank you.

1474
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:39,550
May I inquire as to how
you've avoided detection?

1475
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:42,690
A fake ID works better
than a Guy Fawkes mask.

1476
01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:48,230
I must confess, every time I heard a siren,
I worried about you.

1477
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:51,730
I worried about myself for a while.

1478
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:54,670
But then, one day, I was at a market...

1479
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:58,900
and a friend, someone I had worked
with at the BTN, got in line behind me.

1480
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:04,240
I was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money, I dropped it.

1481
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,880
My friend picked it up...

1482
01:46:08,050 --> 01:46:10,110
and handed it to me.

1483
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:13,190
She looked at me right in the eyes...

1484
01:46:14,190 --> 01:46:16,060
didn't recognize me.

1485
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:21,450
Whatever you did to me worked better
than I'd have imagined.

1486
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,960
I have a gift for you, Evey...

1487
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:35,130
but before I give it to you,
I'd like to ask you something.

1488
01:46:35,310 --> 01:46:38,280
Would you dance with me?

1489
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:42,810
Now? On the eve of your revolution?

1490
01:46:42,990 --> 01:46:46,480
A revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having.

1491
01:46:48,090 --> 01:46:49,320
I'd love to.

1492
01:46:50,790 --> 01:46:53,920
Tonight, I will speak directly
to these people...

1493
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:56,530
and make the situation
perfectly clear to them.

1494
01:46:56,700 --> 01:47:02,260
The security of this nation depends
on complete and total compliance.

1495
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:06,970
Tonight, any protestor,
any instigator or agitator...

1496
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:09,870
will be made example of!

1497
01:47:12,150 --> 01:47:15,120
Chancellor, there is a contingency
that has not been addressed.

1498
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:17,120
And what is that, Mr. Dascomb?

1499
01:47:17,290 --> 01:47:19,480
- Should the terrorist succeed...
- He won't.

1500
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:23,180
I understand that it is highly unlikely,
but if he does...

1501
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:27,130
If he does, and something happens
to that building...

1502
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:30,560
the only thing that will change,
the only difference it will make...

1503
01:47:30,730 --> 01:47:33,460
is that tomorrow morning,
instead of a newspaper...

1504
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:37,500
I will be reading
Mr. Creedy's resignation!

1505
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:46,480
You've been busy.
They're very scared right now.

1506
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:50,710
I heard Sutler's going to make
a public statement tonight.

1507
01:47:50,890 --> 01:47:52,580
It's nearly time.

1508
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:55,420
The masks were ingenious.

1509
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:58,420
It was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere.

1510
01:47:58,590 --> 01:48:01,690
Conceal me what I am,
and be my aid...

1511
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:05,230
for such disguise as haply shall become
the form of my intent.

1512
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:08,270
- Twelfth Night.
- Viola.

1513
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:11,170
- I don't understand.
- What?

1514
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:14,740
How you can be one of the most important
things that has happened to me...

1515
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:17,350
and yet I know
almost nothing about you.

1516
01:48:17,510 --> 01:48:20,310
I don't know where you were born,
who your parents were...

1517
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,920
if you had any brothers or sisters.

1518
01:48:23,090 --> 01:48:26,210
I don't even know
what you really look like.

1519
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:28,410
Evey, please.

1520
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:31,850
There is a face beneath this mask...

1521
01:48:32,030 --> 01:48:33,860
but it's not me.

1522
01:48:34,030 --> 01:48:37,400
I'm no more that face than I am
the muscles beneath it...

1523
01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:39,230
or the bones beneath them.

1524
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:42,700
I understand.

1525
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:45,500
Thank you.

1526
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:48,010
There isn't much time.

1527
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:50,370
I have something I must give you.

1528
01:48:50,650 --> 01:48:52,710
I went by Parliament.

1529
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:57,720
Never seen anything like it.
Tanks, anti-aircraft, infantry.

1530
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:01,520
Makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight.

1531
01:49:03,490 --> 01:49:06,120
But if they do,
what do you think will happen?

1532
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:09,460
What usually happens
when people without guns...

1533
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:12,330
stand up to people with guns.

1534
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,630
Pull over here.

1535
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:18,300
We've searched these tunnels for weeks.
You think you're gonna find him now?

1536
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:23,110
Inspector.

1537
01:49:23,910 --> 01:49:25,780
It's all gone wrong, hasn't it?

1538
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:38,390
The Underground?
I thought they closed this all down.

1539
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:39,790
They did.

1540
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:43,760
It took nearly 10 years to clear the tracks
and lay a bit of my own.

1541
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:47,260
Let me show you.

1542
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:05,280
These tracks lead to Parliament.

1543
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:06,990
Yes.

1544
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:09,680
Then it's really going to happen, isn't it?

1545
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:13,160
It will if you want it to.

1546
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:15,790
- What?
- This is my gift to you, Evey.

1547
01:50:16,370 --> 01:50:21,830
Everything that I have: My home,
my books, the gallery, this train...

1548
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,970
I'm leaving to you to do with
what you will.

1549
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:26,540
Is this another trick, V?

1550
01:50:26,710 --> 01:50:31,080
No. No more tricks. No more lies.

1551
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:33,150
Only truth.

1552
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:36,480
And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong...

1553
01:50:36,990 --> 01:50:41,890
that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make.

1554
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:44,860
- Why?
- Because this world...

1555
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:49,490
the world that I'm a part of and
that I helped shape, will end tonight.

1556
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:52,560
And tomorrow,
a different world will begin...

1557
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:57,830
that different people will shape,
and this choice belongs to them.

1558
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,780
Where are you going?

1559
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:05,340
The time has come for me
to meet my maker...

1560
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:08,850
and to repay him in kind
for all that he's done.

1561
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:11,780
V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.

1562
01:51:11,950 --> 01:51:14,510
You could let it go.
We could leave here together.

1563
01:51:14,690 --> 01:51:17,660
No. You were right about what I am.

1564
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:20,090
I have no tree waiting for me.

1565
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:25,060
All I want, all I deserve,
is at the end of that tunnel.

1566
01:51:25,230 --> 01:51:27,000
That's not true.

1567
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,960
I can't.

1568
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:05,670
My fellow Englishmen...

1569
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:08,230
tonight, our country...

1570
01:52:08,410 --> 01:52:09,940
that which we stand for...

1571
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:11,740
and all that we hold dear...

1572
01:52:11,910 --> 01:52:15,680
faces a grave and terrible threat.

1573
01:52:15,850 --> 01:52:17,320
The area's clean, sir.

1574
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,690
This violent and unparalleled assault
to our security...

1575
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:23,620
will not go undefended.

1576
01:52:23,790 --> 01:52:25,090
Where is he?

1577
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:26,250
Or unpunished.

1578
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:28,590
Penny for the Guy.

1579
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:32,760
Our enemy is an insidious one,
seeking to divide us...

1580
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:37,810
and destroy the very foundation
of our great nation.

1581
01:52:37,970 --> 01:52:42,030
I have kept my side of the bargain,
but have you kept yours?

1582
01:52:42,210 --> 01:52:43,370
Bring him down.

1583
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:45,780
Tonight we must remain steadfast.

1584
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:48,110
We must remain determined.

1585
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:51,480
But most of all,
we must remain united.

1586
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:58,390
Those caught tonight
in violation of curfew...

1587
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:01,190
will be considered in league
with our enemy...

1588
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:04,630
and prosecuted as a terrorist
without leniency or exception.

1589
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,290
I want to see his face.

1590
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:09,930
Tonight I give you
my most solemn vow...

1591
01:53:10,110 --> 01:53:12,510
that justice will be swift...

1592
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:15,140
it will be righteous...

1593
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:17,580
and it will be without mercy.

1594
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:21,910
Oh, God. No.

1595
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:25,990
At last, we finally meet.

1596
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,890
I have something for you, chancellor.

1597
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:32,960
A farewell gift.

1598
01:53:33,130 --> 01:53:36,720
For all the things you've done,
for the things you might have done...

1599
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:38,920
and for the only thing you have left.

1600
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:43,200
Goodbye, chancellor.

1601
01:53:44,210 --> 01:53:45,400
Mr. Creedy.

1602
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:49,540
Disgusting.

1603
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,450
Now that's done with...

1604
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:08,460
it's time to have a look at your face.

1605
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,520
Take off your mask.

1606
01:54:10,830 --> 01:54:12,060
No.

1607
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:29,110
Defiant to the end, huh?

1608
01:54:31,090 --> 01:54:34,680
You won't cry like him, will you?
You're not afraid of death.

1609
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:35,980
You're like me.

1610
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:40,600
The only thing you and I have in common,
Mr. Creedy, is we're both about to die.

1611
01:54:42,230 --> 01:54:43,990
How do you imagine
that's gonna happen?

1612
01:54:44,270 --> 01:54:46,460
With my hands around your neck.

1613
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:49,860
Bollocks.

1614
01:54:50,970 --> 01:54:53,200
What are you gonna do, huh?

1615
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:55,470
We've swept this place.
You've got nothing.

1616
01:54:55,640 --> 01:55:00,050
Nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks.

1617
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:01,770
We have guns.

1618
01:55:01,950 --> 01:55:05,220
No, you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty...

1619
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:07,510
I'm no longer standing,
because if I am...

1620
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:10,450
you'll all be dead
before you've reloaded.

1621
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:12,950
That's impossible!

1622
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:16,420
Kill him.

1623
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:42,180
My turn.

1624
01:56:53,860 --> 01:56:56,060
Die! Die!

1625
01:56:56,970 --> 01:56:59,130
Why won't you die?!

1626
01:57:00,070 --> 01:57:01,430
Why won't you die?

1627
01:57:03,310 --> 01:57:06,400
Beneath this mask
there is more than flesh.

1628
01:57:06,580 --> 01:57:09,370
Beneath this mask there is an idea,
Mr. Creedy.

1629
01:57:10,750 --> 01:57:12,940
And ideas are bulletproof.

1630
01:58:04,670 --> 01:58:07,760
This is perimeter one.
Whitehall is secure. Over.

1631
01:58:07,940 --> 01:58:09,200
This is General Ackroyd.

1632
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:11,160
Keep communication tight.

1633
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:14,610
I won't have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is.

1634
01:58:18,510 --> 01:58:19,850
V!

1635
01:58:24,490 --> 01:58:27,010
Oh, God, we have to stop your bleeding.

1636
01:58:27,190 --> 01:58:31,320
Please, don't. I'm finished and glad of it.

1637
01:58:31,730 --> 01:58:33,320
Don't say that.

1638
01:58:33,830 --> 01:58:36,700
I told you, only truth.

1639
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:43,670
For 20 years I sought only this day.

1640
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:45,970
Nothing else existed...

1641
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:50,030
until I saw you.

1642
01:58:51,210 --> 01:58:53,480
Then everything changed.

1643
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,820
I fell in love with you, Evey...

1644
01:58:58,390 --> 01:59:01,580
like I no longer believed I could.

1645
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:04,230
V, I don't want you to die.

1646
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,760
That's the most beautiful thing...

1647
01:59:10,930 --> 01:59:13,530
you could have ever given me.

1648
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:22,540
V?

1649
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:25,040
V?!

1650
01:59:35,490 --> 01:59:38,460
Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading to Trafalgar Square.

1651
01:59:38,630 --> 01:59:40,650
This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.

1652
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:14,990
Hold it. Stop right there.

1653
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:19,890
You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?

1654
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:29,170
Then it's over?

1655
02:00:29,650 --> 02:00:30,870
Almost.

1656
02:00:31,050 --> 02:00:33,480
Stop. Get your hand off that lever.

1657
02:00:35,850 --> 02:00:36,910
No.

1658
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:40,090
Enemy is approaching fast.
Requesting orders.

1659
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,490
- What shall we do?
- No response from Command.

1660
02:00:43,930 --> 02:00:46,260
Or from Party Leader Creedy.

1661
02:00:46,430 --> 02:00:47,730
Or from the high chancellor.

1662
02:00:48,630 --> 02:00:49,860
Why are you doing this?

1663
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:52,770
- Because he was right.
- About what?

1664
02:00:52,940 --> 02:00:57,430
That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.

1665
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:04,970
Bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!

1666
02:01:31,770 --> 02:01:34,170
Jesus bloody Christ.

1667
02:01:59,470 --> 02:02:00,560
It's time.

1668
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:23,250
Tell me...

1669
02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:26,780
do you like music, Mr. Finch?

1670
02:02:46,380 --> 02:02:48,370
That music?

1671
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,320
Yes.

1672
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:52,310
His music.

1673
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:25,810
Who was he?

1674
02:03:27,090 --> 02:03:28,320
He was Edmond Dantes.

1675
02:03:30,490 --> 02:03:35,000
And he was my father...
and my mother.

1676
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:37,330
My brother.

1677
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:41,200
My friend.

1678
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:44,130
He was you...

1679
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:47,680
and me.

1680
02:03:49,780 --> 02:03:51,640
He was all of us.

1681
02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:23,540
No one will ever forget that night...

1682
02:04:23,710 --> 02:04:26,370
and what it meant for this country.

1683
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:29,320
But I will never forget the man...

1684
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:31,150
and what he meant to me.
