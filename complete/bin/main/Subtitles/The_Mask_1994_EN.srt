1
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:50,800
Got another one coming down, Mike.

2
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,051
Hang on a sec.

3
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,948
I got those...

4
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,241
concert tickets you wanted.

5
00:01:58,067 --> 00:01:59,535
You're kidding!

6
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,012
For Friday night?

7
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,581
Stanley, this is great.

8
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,974
So, what time should I pick you up?

9
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,252
Well, see, here's the thing.

10
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:12,048
My very best girlfriend just came into town
and I know she'd be dying to go to this...

11
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:14,926
so could we maybe get an
extra ticket for her?

12
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,264
They're out. They're sold out.
That means there's no more.

13
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,519
Well, I can't let her sit home all alone.

14
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,564
Look, I'll tell you what.

15
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,804
Why don't you just go with your friend.

16
00:02:31,757 --> 00:02:33,694
Stanley, I couldn't do that.

17
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,154
No, come on.

18
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:38,783
Stanley, you are the nicest guy.

19
00:02:39,444 --> 00:02:41,155
Really, you are.

20
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:45,059
- Charlie, isn't Stanley the nicest guy?
- The best.

21
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:52,441
That was the most sickening display

22
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,216
- I've ever seen.
- I disagree.

23
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,884
I think I'm wearing her down.

24
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,304
Buddy, you know what you need?
You need a little change of pace.

25
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,307
Tonight, I'm gonna take you
on a love safari.

26
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,811
Deep into the darkest heart
of the urban jungle.

27
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:08,896
Tell me more, bwana.

28
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,817
The Coco Bongo Club.
Hottest new joint in town.

29
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,361
Only the crème de la crème
need apply.

30
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,698
- So how do we get in?
- What, are you kiddin'?

31
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,117
Leave it to me. Trust me, buddy.

32
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:25,830
This is going to be the perfect
night on the town.

33
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:40,469
Hold the phone.

34
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:43,902
Killer at three o'clock.

35
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,837
Stand back and observe.

36
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,343
Excuse me, where can I open a new account?

37
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:22,178
New accounts, right here.

38
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,722
You know, you're lucky you've caught
me, I was just on my way out...

39
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:26,432
Hold this for me, please?

40
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,551
- I will hold anything you want.
- Thank you.

41
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,189
Can you help me?

42
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,007
So...

43
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,261
what kind of account do you have in mind?

44
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:07,640
I'm not sure exactly. You see I'm
just terrible with things like that.

45
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,018
That's an interesting tie, Mister...

46
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,479
Ipkiss, Stanley Ipkiss.

47
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,147
Tina Carlyle, it's a pleasure.

48
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,941
The pleasure's all mine.

49
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,943
May I?

50
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:20,603
May what?

51
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:22,834
I'm such a mess.

52
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,949
Oh, of course.

53
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:28,426
That's what they're there for.

54
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,583
As I was saying, about that tie...

55
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,670
kinda reminds me of one of those,
what do you call it, ink blot tests.

56
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:40,673
- A Rorschach test.
- Right.

57
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:42,925
You know, it sort of looks like...

58
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,845
a young woman riding bareback.

59
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,930
Sort of a...

60
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,557
Lady Godiva or something.

61
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,476
Of course.

62
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,980
What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?

63
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,026
I don't know.

64
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,040
Bright colours...

65
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,625
It's a power tie.

66
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,543
Supposed to make you feel...

67
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,670
powerful.

68
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,172
Does it work?

69
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:29,472
Now, how about that account?

70
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,850
We have several different plans.

71
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,227
Savings.

72
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:39,857
Checking.

73
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,484
Savings and checking.

74
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,819
CD's. Savings and CD's.

75
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,196
Checking and CD's.

76
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,199
Savings, checking and CD's.
T-Bills.

77
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,281
Or we can just take all your money and
throw it in a big mattress back there.

78
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,293
Now, I have some forms
for you to fill out.

79
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:11,138
That's it, sweetheart.
Now just a little bit to the right.

80
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,140
Could you guys keep it down back there?

81
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,893
We'll try.

82
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:19,753
- So what do you think?
- Layout's not bad. But them...

83
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:22,519
motion detectors are a pain in the ass.

84
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,667
- But you can pull this off, right?
- Hey.

85
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:27,446
You talking to the Doctor.

86
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,448
I do have one question.

87
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:31,325
Which is?

88
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:34,309
What does Niko have to say about this?

89
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:35,936
Nothing.

90
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,458
- This isn't his grift.
- Get real, man.

91
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,419
Everything is his grift.

92
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,756
He owns you, he owns this club,
he owns this whole stinking town.

93
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:49,177
Things change.

94
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,097
You mess with Niko, you end up
taking a dirt nap.

95
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,934
He's the only one who's napping...

96
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,731
and I'm about to give him
a serious wake-up call.

97
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:04,399
But we need some cash...

98
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,277
so first we take the bank...

99
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,820
then we take Niko...

100
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,156
and then, my friend,
school is out.

101
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,744
And this whole city is our playground.

102
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,919
Hey, bub, watch where you're going!

103
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:33,399
Hello!

104
00:08:37,695 --> 00:08:38,695
Hello!

105
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,102
Hang on, hang on!

106
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,439
Don't get your panties
in a twist, would ya?

107
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,733
Hey Burt, what the hell is it?

108
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,944
I don't know...

109
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,238
about seven hundred bucks, eh?

110
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,033
Now, what can I do for you, bub?

111
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,077
I'm here for the Civic.

112
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:59,997
The brake drums are shot
and you need a new transmission.

113
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:01,749
What?!

114
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,835
All I wanted was an oil change.

115
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,190
Well you're lucky we caught these problems now
before they caused you some serious trouble.

116
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,051
Sign right here, and press down hard.

117
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,721
- There's no price.
- There will be.

118
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,308
I don't have a car.
I have to have a car tonight.

119
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:21,613
- Irv!
- Yo.

120
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,813
Bring around the loaner.

121
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:25,731
The loaner?

122
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:27,892
The loaner?

123
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,557
It's a classic.

124
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,049
Charlie.

125
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:10,245
Stanley.

126
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,029
Gals, I want you to meet
my buddy Stanley Ipkiss.

127
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,532
Humungo in the banking business.

128
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:19,464
- Not really.
- Hey what do you say, we get in this joint, huh?

129
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,789
Yo Bobby! How you doing, buddy?

130
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,626
- It's Charlie!
- Hey, Charlie, how you doing?

131
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,253
- How are you? How are you doing, my friend?
- Long time no see.

132
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,923
Hey, good to see you. Okay then.

133
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,758
Come on, gals. Let's get going.

134
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:36,118
See you on the inside.

135
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:38,889
Bobby?

136
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:40,553
Eh, Charlie? Charlie!

137
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,230
This is a mistake.

138
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,152
You crossed the rope.
Never cross the rope.

139
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,345
- But my friends are on the inside.
- Lose him.

140
00:10:55,392 --> 00:10:58,157
Hey, come on now guys. Now this isn't fair.

141
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,492
Watch it, I'm a bleeder.

142
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,737
Put me down right now, or I am
never coming back here.

143
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,132
Ah jeez.

144
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,417
Mr. Ipkiss! Hi.

145
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:33,204
Hi.

146
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,034
Are you okay?

147
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:37,488
Me?

148
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,823
I'm great..

149
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:39,824
Really good.

150
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,118
I just never felt better, really.

151
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,245
I'm just...

152
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,580
catching some air out here.

153
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,498
Your car, sir.

154
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,917
That's not my car.

155
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:52,023
But it matches the ticket.

156
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,133
Alright...

157
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,218
I'll take it.

158
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,097
But I am very angry!

159
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,184
Believe this?

160
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,812
You drive in in a Porsche...

161
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,243
Oh, jeez!

162
00:13:49,802 --> 00:13:50,849
Hey!

163
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,459
Hey, Mister!

164
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,131
Hold on!

165
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,384
I know CPR!

166
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,340
Hey, you!

167
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:45,809
What are you doing down there?

168
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,597
I'm just looking for...

169
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,558
my mask!

170
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,353
I got it.

171
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,740
Ipkiss! Do you have any idea what time it is?

172
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:10,023
Actually, no.

173
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,871
My new carpet!

174
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:17,750
Well, this is coming right out
of your security deposit, Ipkiss.

175
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:20,039
You know, Mrs. Peenman...

176
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:21,193
What?

177
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:25,967
Nothing.

178
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,553
Well, that's what you are, Ipkiss,
a big nothing.

179
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,562
Aren't you due back at the laboratory
to get your bolts tightened?

180
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,357
I should have said that.

181
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,700
Hey, you.

182
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,618
Milo!

183
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,289
You know you're not supposed to jump up.
It's against doggie ordinance.

184
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:22,773
What?

185
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,650
You want me to throw that?

186
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,153
I'm very tired.

187
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,155
Okay. I'll throw it one time.

188
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,241
I cannot throw it with you
attached to it.

189
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,538
You ready?

190
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,165
Get it.

191
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,793
Ipkiss!
Turn down those cartoons!

192
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,296
Alright, Mrs. Peenman!

193
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,369
So Dr. Neuman, you're saying
that everybody wears a mask?

194
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:55,890
That's correct, Wendy.

195
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,935
We all wear masks,
metaphorically speaking.

196
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,021
We suppress the id,
our darkest desires...

197
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,066
and adopt a more socially
acceptable image.

198
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:09,403
Well, the book is of course "The Masks We Wear"
by Dr. Arthur Neuman.

199
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,239
Thank you so much for being with us today.

200
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,620
What's the matter with you?

201
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:18,830
What is it?

202
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,166
What are you looking for?

203
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,211
You like this thing? You like it?

204
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,048
"The Masks We Wear".

205
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,386
"That's correct, Wendy.

206
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,056
"We all wear masks,
metaphorically speaking."

207
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,233
Yeah, right.

208
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:29,442
Smoking!

209
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,529
It's party time.

210
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,989
P-A-R-T...

211
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,201
Why? Because I gotta.

212
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,038
Snooze!

213
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:52,483
Look, ma, I'm road kill!

214
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,787
- Hey, get out of the road!
- I think he wants to communicate.

215
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,559
Hey, mister...

216
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,603
you got the time?

217
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,272
As a matter of fact, I do, Cubbie!

218
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:34,295
- You wanna take him?
- Yeah.

219
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,652
Look at that!

220
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:40,823
It's exactly two seconds before I honk your
nose and pull your underwear over your head.

221
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,081
Come on!

222
00:20:49,372 --> 00:20:50,972
- Kill him! Come on!
- Come on! Take him!

223
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,091
Step right up here, don't be shy!

224
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,678
Nobody likes
a bashful leather head.

225
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:03,947
Move it!

226
00:21:04,414 --> 00:21:06,791
For my first trick...

227
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,727
I'd like to do something for you, son.

228
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:17,276
We have a giraffe. There you go, son.
Now get out of here, you bother me.

229
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,405
Now...

230
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,408
Sorry, wrong pocket.

231
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,785
For you, son...

232
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,788
a little body English.

233
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,044
A French poodle.

234
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,340
Sorry son, the dog was
rabid, had to put it down.

235
00:21:39,963 --> 00:21:43,553
And last but not least, my favourite.

236
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,191
A Tommy gun.

237
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,455
This is incredible.

238
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,125
With these powers I could be...

239
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,088
a superhero.

240
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,257
I could fight crime,
protect the innocent...

241
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,969
work for world peace.

242
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,637
But first...

243
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:39,609
Hold onto your lug nuts,
it's time for an overhaul.

244
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,532
It was a dream.

245
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,536
It was a dream.

246
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,416
I must lay off the cartoons.

247
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:47,537
Ipkiss, Stanley Ipkiss?

248
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:48,631
Yes.

249
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:52,473
Lt. Kellaway, City Precinct. You know
anything about the disturbance last night?

250
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,185
Disturbance?

251
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,522
Yeah, some kind of prowler broke in
and attacked Mrs. Peenman.

252
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:01,065
Attacked?

253
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,775
You didn't hear anything?

254
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:07,154
She unloaded a couple of rounds of 20
gauge buckshot 5 feet from your door.

255
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,323
Look at the floor. See that?

256
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,868
He put that right in my floor,
then he jumped out...

257
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:15,413
the window. Officer,
are you writing notes?

258
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,755
This is...

259
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:18,541
impossible.

260
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:21,460
Those pyjamas are impossible.
This actually happened.

261
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,214
See, I have...

262
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,425
an inner ear problem.

263
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,721
- Sometimes I can't hear anything.
- Is that a fact?

264
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:39,395
Here's my card. If you remember
anything unusual about last night...

265
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:42,023
anything at all, call me.

266
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,733
You bet ya. Thank you.

267
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,902
And good luck...

268
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,502
cracking the case.

269
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,961
Oh, my God, I'm late!

270
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,215
Keys, keys...

271
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,091
Where's the keys?

272
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,427
Damn.

273
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,347
Milo! Get the keys.

274
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,598
Get them! Find them.

275
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,811
Get the keys.

276
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,531
I am so late.

277
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,660
Good boy. Good boy.

278
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,996
Come on, Milo. Give them to me.
Drop it!

279
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:13,489
- I want a proctologist standing by.
<i>- What?</i>

280
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:16,173
You heard me! The best one you can find.

281
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,494
I'm with the Evening Star.
Can you tell me what happened here?

282
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,353
- No, and you can quote me.
- Well, it looks like some sort of Mob tactic.

283
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:26,711
There it is, boys. She broke the case.
Come on, get these rubbernecks out of here.

284
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:35,592
Hey Stanley. Stanley, Stanley!

285
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:39,342
Where were you last night? The girls
and I were looking all over for you.

286
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,197
Did you happen to look outside,
in the gutter?

287
00:26:42,244 --> 00:26:43,978
Hey, did you check the morning paper?

288
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,855
Your girlfriend got a great review.

289
00:26:47,353 --> 00:26:50,902
Ipkiss, you're 40 minutes late.
That's the same as stealing.

290
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:55,698
I'm sorry, Mr. Dickey. It'll never
happen again. I've been a jerk.

291
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,534
Well, if you weren't busy oogling
girlie pictures...

292
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,912
you might get some work done around here.

293
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:04,790
Sir. She's a perspective
client of Stanley's.

294
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,292
Oh really?

295
00:27:08,702 --> 00:27:10,202
Well.

296
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,049
The next time she comes in...

297
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,108
you be sure to send her to my office.

298
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:17,887
You bet ya.

299
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,144
Gee, I wish my daddy
owned a bank.

300
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:28,481
Then I could be a rich
little creep too.

301
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,441
You think she'll ever come back, Charlie?

302
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:34,111
Oh, man, forget her. Stanley, listen to me.

303
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:38,210
A girl like that is always looking for
the BBD: the Bigger Better Deal.

304
00:27:38,296 --> 00:27:40,159
You don't know that, Charlie.

305
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:43,287
She's an artist. She's...

306
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,581
- she's sensitive.
- Stanley, forget her.

307
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:49,752
That girl will tear out your heart,
put it in a blender and hit "frappé".

308
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:53,673
You don't need her, man.
You need somebody down to earth.

309
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:57,844
Somebody with some integrity.
Somebody with...

310
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,178
red hair...

311
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,138
and full, pouting lips...

312
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,851
a white blouse, green jacket
and a name tag.

313
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,186
Boy, you really narrowed it down.

314
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,438
Too bad she's already taken.

315
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,985
Hello there, may I be of some assistance?

316
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,070
Stanley Ipkiss?

317
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:21,701
Hi! I'm Peggy Brandt
from the Tribune.

318
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,597
Oh, hi.

319
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:27,623
Look I cancelled my subscription because
they kept stealing my paper...

320
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,543
Oh no no, actually, I was just
gonna ask you a few questions.

321
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:33,296
Really? About what?

322
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,252
Ripley Auto Finishing.
You're a customer of theirs, aren't you?

323
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,304
Me, no?

324
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,348
I don't even have a car.

325
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:47,059
You know, 'cause they pollute.

326
00:28:47,385 --> 00:28:49,887
You don't own an '89 Civic?

327
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,858
Oh, that car, yeah.

328
00:28:55,142 --> 00:28:56,040
Yeah.

329
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,446
It's all coming back to me.

330
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,990
Miss... What did you say your name was?

331
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:02,325
Peggy Brandt.

332
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:04,619
Wait a minute.

333
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,412
Peggy Brandt?

334
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:08,442
Of "Ask Peggy"?

335
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,833
Yeah that's right.

336
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,836
You printed one of my letters
last year.

337
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:16,380
Remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last".

338
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,159
- You're Mister Nice Guy?
- Yes!

339
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:24,686
Oh Stanley! Do you realize how much mail
we got about that letter?

340
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:29,101
I mean there are literally hundreds of women
out there looking for a guy just like you.

341
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,356
- Really?
- Yeah!

342
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,567
Do you know how hard it is to find
a decent man in this town?

343
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:39,362
Most of 'em think monogamy
is some kind of wood.

344
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:47,119
So why are you covering this story?

345
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:50,915
Because "Dear Peggy" pays dick.
I'm starving to death.

346
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:53,167
I'm looking to become a real reporter.

347
00:29:53,516 --> 00:29:57,255
Look, Stanley, when you were at Ripley Auto
did you see anything suspicious?

348
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,548
Anything at all?

349
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,591
I won't make trouble for you.

350
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,176
I just want the truth.

351
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:07,515
God, I wish I knew the truth.
You know, I really do.

352
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:09,886
No.

353
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:13,396
Well, if you think of anything...

354
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,314
this is my number.

355
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,191
This is my...

356
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:19,694
you know, personal number.

357
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:24,464
You really think hundreds of women
are looking for a guy like me?

358
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:25,884
Sure.

359
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,744
I'm one of them.

360
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,088
<i>120 yards.</i>

361
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,887
Hello, Dorian.

362
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,809
Thanks for dropping by.

363
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:56,768
Yeah, well... Next time, why don't you call,
right? Leave the delivery boys at home.

364
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,795
The cops...

365
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:23,716
tried to shut the club
down this morning.

366
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:28,471
They say you've been using the place
to run your own small-time scams.

367
00:31:28,963 --> 00:31:30,811
I hear things like that...

368
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,602
I start losing my concentration.

369
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:37,313
My game...

370
00:31:37,882 --> 00:31:40,525
it goes straight to hell.

371
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:45,238
You could too.

372
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,908
<i>205 yards.</i>

373
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,412
I'm fed up with you, Dorian...

374
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:53,412
but...

375
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,164
I'm going to cut you a break.

376
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:59,836
One week to get out of town.

377
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:01,963
After that...

378
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:06,676
I'll use your empty little skull
to break in my new nine iron.

379
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:37,634
Mr. Ipkiss, hi.

380
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:46,174
Hi.

381
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,567
You okay?

382
00:32:49,111 --> 00:32:51,170
Your car, sir.

383
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,684
I am now.

384
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:16,913
Tina, come on.

385
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,624
You can't.

386
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,126
You can't.

387
00:33:24,093 --> 00:33:25,288
Milo!

388
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,173
Go on.

389
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,302
I don't believe it.

390
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,949
Stupid.

391
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:56,661
She would never...

392
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:24,605
No way!

393
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:55,052
Hold on, Sugar.

394
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:58,347
Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight.

395
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:17,617
Somebody, stop me.

396
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,333
Can't make the scene
if you don't have the green.

397
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,585
I better make a little stop.

398
00:35:38,272 --> 00:35:39,597
<i>How's it going, Freeze?</i>

399
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,476
Looking good here, my man.

400
00:35:41,562 --> 00:35:45,520
Okay, you boys are on your own now. I gotta
get go downstairs and make sure I'm seen.

401
00:35:45,805 --> 00:35:46,646
Do it.

402
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:50,233
The doctor is about to operate.

403
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:16,217
Sorry, fellas. Waste not, want not.

404
00:36:27,598 --> 00:36:28,932
Cops!

405
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,201
You're not on the list, you're
not in the club, alright?

406
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,386
How do?

407
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:07,685
Are you on the list?

408
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:12,940
No, but I believe my friends are.
Perhaps you know them?

409
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:16,027
Franklin, Grant and Jackson.

410
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,912
Stay behind! That's it, that's it!
Nobody's getting in.

411
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:33,336
And now we present to you the most
beautiful flower of the Congo Bongo...

00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:35,546
Miss Tina Carlyle.

Smoking.

443
00:41:05,406 --> 00:41:06,824
What happened?

444
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,762
Someone hit the joint before got her.

445
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,107
Get that, Doc.

446
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,227
Here, my buddy. Suck on that.

447
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:26,235
Son of a bitch!

448
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,990
Eddy, who did this, man?

449
00:41:31,073 --> 00:41:32,783
Who?!

450
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:34,994
Him!

451
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:37,663
Him! There! That's the guy.

452
00:41:38,506 --> 00:41:40,436
That guy dancing with Tina?

453
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:41,918
He's dead meat.

454
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:43,127
Come on.

455
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:26,629
I want this place cleared right now.

456
00:42:42,612 --> 00:42:43,464
Hello!

457
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:47,775
Club's closed. Move it!
You think I'm joking? Come on, move it!

458
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,709
Party's over. Everyone, let's go!

459
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,086
Tina, get out of here.

460
00:42:53,531 --> 00:42:54,490
Get lost!

461
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:57,660
Okay, Twinkle Toes.

462
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:00,204
I wanna know where my money is,
and I wanna know right now.

463
00:43:00,696 --> 00:43:02,039
Okay.

464
00:43:06,344 --> 00:43:09,993
You've got 17.5% in T-bills
amortised over the fiscal year.

465
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:11,556
8% in stocks and bonds.

466
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:13,633
Carry the 9, divide by the
Gross National Product...

467
00:43:13,664 --> 00:43:17,388
Fortunately, funeral bouquets
are deductible.

468
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:20,377
Ice this deadbeat.

469
00:43:26,397 --> 00:43:27,315
Shoot him!

470
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:33,654
Thank you very much.

471
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,915
You got me, partner.

472
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,763
Hold me close, Red.

473
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,723
It's getting dark.

474
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:08,606
Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller out.

475
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:15,863
Tell Tiny Tim I won't be
coming home this Christmas.

476
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:22,703
Tell Scarlet I do give a damn.

477
00:44:27,553 --> 00:44:28,470
Pardon me.

478
00:44:36,884 --> 00:44:38,469
Thank you.

479
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:41,514
You love me.

480
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:44,600
You really love me.

481
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:52,608
You're not going anywhere.

482
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,025
Drop it, Tyrel!

483
00:45:04,398 --> 00:45:05,906
Hey, Kellaway.

484
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:07,386
Drop it.

485
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,254
So you got a warrant this time?
Or did you stop by for a nightcap?

486
00:45:14,547 --> 00:45:17,258
What I got is probable cause.

487
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:19,677
Couple of your boys were spotted
knocking over Edge City Bank.

488
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,596
Easy. You're giving me a woody.

489
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:24,307
And one of 'em was wearing
a big, green mask.

490
00:45:24,676 --> 00:45:26,976
You know, for once, Kellaway, you're right.

491
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:29,478
Except it wasn't one of my boys.

492
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,149
Maybe if you tried a little
actual police work...

493
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:34,995
- Cuff him.
- Hey Lieutenant!

494
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:38,722
We got a stiff upstairs.
It's one of the guys from the heist.

495
00:45:38,753 --> 00:45:41,157
Better call that high-priced
lawyer of yours, Tyrel.

496
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:43,534
You and I are going
downtown for a little chat.

497
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:45,736
Get him out of here.

498
00:45:58,776 --> 00:46:00,049
Ipkiss.

499
00:46:05,598 --> 00:46:08,684
Ipkiss, I know you're in there.

500
00:46:11,562 --> 00:46:13,064
Police!

501
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:16,400
Open up!

502
00:46:16,484 --> 00:46:19,195
Oh, my God.

503
00:46:21,906 --> 00:46:25,368
Ipkiss, I know you're in there!

504
00:46:32,397 --> 00:46:33,125
Open up!

505
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:36,077
Come on, I'm getting blisters
on my fingers.

506
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:37,741
Milo, no. No!

507
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:41,054
No! No, no!

508
00:46:41,342 --> 00:46:42,385
Stop it.

509
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:44,720
I'm coming, okay.

510
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:47,348
I'm coming. I'll be right there.

511
00:46:51,435 --> 00:46:53,729
Let's go, Ipkiss, move it!

512
00:46:53,771 --> 00:46:55,731
Alright!

513
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:03,072
Hi, Lieutenant.

514
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:06,826
Listen, this isn't the best time right now.
I just...

515
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:08,828
Won't you come in?

516
00:47:11,706 --> 00:47:13,124
Where were you last night, Ipkiss?

517
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:15,751
Here, mostly.

518
00:47:15,835 --> 00:47:16,794
Is something wrong?

519
00:47:16,878 --> 00:47:18,880
What do you know about this mask character?

520
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,048
"Mask?"

521
00:47:21,132 --> 00:47:22,800
Don't insult my intelligence, Ipkiss.

522
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:26,679
He robs the bank you work in,
then I find this in the Coco Bongo.

523
00:47:26,824 --> 00:47:29,452
There can't be 2 idiots
with pyjamas like these.

524
00:47:30,246 --> 00:47:31,309
Milo, no!

525
00:47:32,165 --> 00:47:34,376
May I see those pyjamas, Mr. Ipkiss?

526
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:37,857
Those pyjamas?

527
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:41,252
Those... Those... Those pyjamas were...

528
00:47:42,111 --> 00:47:43,279
stolen.

529
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,416
Somebody stole your pyjamas?

530
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:55,583
I mean, what is this city coming to...

531
00:47:55,666 --> 00:48:00,880
when a man's pyjama drawer is
no longer safe!

532
00:48:06,135 --> 00:48:07,678
Look at that guy.

533
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:10,932
- Nobody's that fast at my bank.
- I'll say.

534
00:48:13,726 --> 00:48:16,187
I don't know, boss. That's
one hell of a rubber mask.

535
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:17,719
What do the lab reports say?

536
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:22,193
I only got some got fingerprints on some of the
currency, but nothing matches Tyrel's men.

537
00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:23,820
Looks like this guy beat them to the punch.

538
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:28,699
Get the bank employee files and run down the
prints on a guy named Ipkiss. Stanley Ipkiss.

539
00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:31,087
You figure it was an inside job, huh?

540
00:48:31,134 --> 00:48:34,956
That's right, and all I need is a couple of
prints to lock this whack job up till doomsday.

541
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,460
50 grand...

542
00:48:39,544 --> 00:48:44,394
50 grand to the man who finds that green-faced
son of a bitch before the cops do.

543
00:48:44,426 --> 00:48:47,552
I want you to get the word out
to every street hustler...

544
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:50,388
to every low life in this town.
You understand?

545
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:53,599
I want him here tomorrow, alive.

546
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:56,853
You still here?

547
00:48:56,894 --> 00:48:58,855
Come on, let's go!

548
00:49:03,943 --> 00:49:05,653
What are you looking at?

549
00:49:05,736 --> 00:49:06,821
You.

550
00:49:06,904 --> 00:49:08,489
You're losing it, Dorian.

551
00:49:10,205 --> 00:49:12,326
I'm not losing anything...

552
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,245
except maybe some extra
baggage around here.

553
00:49:14,773 --> 00:49:16,358
What is that supposed to mean?

554
00:49:16,711 --> 00:49:17,789
You know...

555
00:49:18,249 --> 00:49:22,085
You weren't putting up much of a fight in that
freak show last night when he tried to kiss you.

556
00:49:22,148 --> 00:49:24,881
Did it look like I had much
of a choice?

557
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:27,717
Maybe you did...

558
00:49:30,156 --> 00:49:32,784
maybe you didn't. Who knows, right?

559
00:49:34,432 --> 00:49:35,725
I'll tell you one thing.

560
00:49:36,934 --> 00:49:40,188
It's going to be payback for
anybody who crosses me.

561
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:50,776
Ipkiss!

562
00:49:50,823 --> 00:49:54,410
We have a crisis on our hands here and you
stroll in over an hour late?

563
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:56,454
If I have to put up with your...

564
00:49:56,537 --> 00:49:59,332
Back off, monkey boy...

565
00:49:59,422 --> 00:50:03,092
before I tell your daddy you're running this
place like it's your own personal piggy bank.

566
00:50:03,169 --> 00:50:05,087
Or maybe we should call the IRS...

567
00:50:05,129 --> 00:50:08,382
and see if we can arrange a little
vacation for you at Club Fed?

568
00:50:11,552 --> 00:50:13,471
That'll be all, Ipkiss.

569
00:50:17,225 --> 00:50:18,476
Genius.

570
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,230
That was genius. Buddy, I have chills.

571
00:50:22,313 --> 00:50:26,150
God! What side of whose bed
did you wake up on, man?

572
00:50:26,234 --> 00:50:27,652
I'm not sure.

573
00:50:28,694 --> 00:50:31,155
I haven't exactly been myself lately.

574
00:50:31,197 --> 00:50:33,241
Well you don't look real fabulous, now.

575
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:35,284
Really, do I look bad?

576
00:50:36,536 --> 00:50:40,081
Not to worry. This'll put the colour
back in your cheeks, my friend.

577
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:44,460
2 tickets to the charity ball at the
Coco Bongo Club, this Saturday night.

578
00:50:44,502 --> 00:50:47,004
Anybody who's anybody will be there.

579
00:50:47,088 --> 00:50:48,994
Want to be my date?

580
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:51,096
Charlie, I...

581
00:50:55,593 --> 00:50:57,974
Wait just a minute.

582
00:50:58,015 --> 00:51:01,352
- Tina, what are you doing here?
- I just wanted to thank you, but...

583
00:51:02,503 --> 00:51:06,105
I'm not sure if I'm gonna have much
to open an account with anymore.

584
00:51:06,176 --> 00:51:08,818
What about the club?
I thought you were doing great.

585
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,500
Look, it's not your problem.
I'll be okay.

586
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:13,531
Tina, come here.

587
00:51:18,327 --> 00:51:21,706
You didn't stop by just to see me,
did you?

588
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,626
It's okay, tell me.

589
00:51:28,296 --> 00:51:30,965
The guy they say robbed this place...

590
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:33,970
- The Mask?
- I think he was at the club last night.

591
00:51:34,886 --> 00:51:36,220
Really?

592
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:38,890
They say he's pretty...

593
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,426
weird looking.

594
00:51:43,352 --> 00:51:44,812
Yeah, but...

595
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:47,273
you ought to see him dance.

596
00:51:49,025 --> 00:51:52,487
So, did anyone find out who he is?

597
00:51:53,398 --> 00:51:54,829
Why are you interested?

598
00:51:56,574 --> 00:51:58,701
Just curious, I guess.

599
00:52:00,828 --> 00:52:04,290
Well, I better be going.

600
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:06,334
Thanks for everything, Stanley.

601
00:52:08,002 --> 00:52:09,970
You'd like to see him again, wouldn't you?

602
00:52:13,533 --> 00:52:17,261
I wouldn't mind.

603
00:52:18,063 --> 00:52:19,972
I know him, you know.

604
00:52:20,673 --> 00:52:21,724
You do?

605
00:52:22,087 --> 00:52:24,894
We're old college buddies,
him and me.

606
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:29,649
It's funny you should mention
the way he dances because...

607
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:36,823
I taught him a couple of
dance moves myself.

608
00:52:36,906 --> 00:52:40,034
Do you think you could have him
meet me tonight?

609
00:52:40,117 --> 00:52:42,203
I might be able to work something out.

610
00:52:42,286 --> 00:52:45,379
- How about at Landfill Park?
- Okay. Sunset.

611
00:52:45,437 --> 00:52:47,314
- Perfect.
- Super.

612
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:52,004
Thanks, Stanley.
You really are a nice guy.

613
00:52:58,886 --> 00:53:01,097
This is an interesting piece, Mr. Ipkiss.

614
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,350
Looks like fourth-
or fifth-century Scandinavian.

615
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:08,813
Possibly a representation of one
of the Norse night gods, maybe Loki.

616
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:13,484
Loki?

617
00:53:13,568 --> 00:53:14,986
Who is Loki?

618
00:53:15,563 --> 00:53:17,530
The Norse god of mischief.

619
00:53:17,621 --> 00:53:22,585
Supposedly he caused so much trouble that
Odin banished him from Valhalla forever.

620
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,331
Then he could have banished him
into that mask.

621
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:30,459
I'm talking about mythology,
Mr. Ipkiss.

622
00:53:30,644 --> 00:53:32,604
This is a piece of wood.

623
00:53:33,462 --> 00:53:35,006
But your book...!

624
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,823
My book is about
masks as a metaphor, Mr. Ipkiss.

625
00:53:38,878 --> 00:53:41,804
A metaphor, not to be taken literally.

626
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,928
You suffer from a mild delusion.

627
00:53:46,934 --> 00:53:48,352
Alright.

628
00:53:51,814 --> 00:53:53,483
I'll prove it to you.

629
00:53:54,692 --> 00:53:58,237
But I am not responsible
for the consequences.

630
00:53:58,461 --> 00:54:02,340
Just sit back and enjoy the ride,
Mr. Expert.

631
00:54:02,713 --> 00:54:05,758
You don't scare me, Mr. Ipkiss.
Go right ahead.

632
00:54:06,704 --> 00:54:08,623
See you.

633
00:54:33,731 --> 00:54:38,152
Okay. You said Loki was a night god.
Maybe it only works at night.

634
00:54:38,384 --> 00:54:43,847
Mr. Ipkiss, I should warn you that I don't work
personally with really sick people.

635
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,916
There are private institutions
for things like that.

636
00:54:46,971 --> 00:54:51,249
However, if you would like me t arrange for a
safe environment for you tonight, I can do that.

637
00:54:52,276 --> 00:54:53,245
No.

638
00:54:55,495 --> 00:54:57,288
I've gotta see Tina.

639
00:54:58,381 --> 00:55:00,049
But what do I do, I mean?

640
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:03,010
Do I go as myself...

641
00:55:03,094 --> 00:55:04,679
or the Mask?

642
00:55:06,224 --> 00:55:10,354
If I tell you, you promise
to leave my office right now?

643
00:55:12,747 --> 00:55:14,247
Alright.

644
00:55:14,552 --> 00:55:15,747
Mr. Ipkiss...

645
00:55:16,899 --> 00:55:21,070
go as yourself and as the Mask.

646
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:25,533
Because they are both
one and the same beautiful person.

647
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:30,496
<i>Got the cross-check on the fingerprints
for you. It's Ipkiss alright.</i>

648
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,873
I'm looking at him.

649
00:55:32,142 --> 00:55:34,424
Just keep the SWAT team standing by.

650
00:55:34,653 --> 00:55:38,426
If this guy's half as bad as he's supposed to be,
we're gonna have a full dance card.

651
00:55:38,966 --> 00:55:40,126
Did you have a pickle relish?

652
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:41,325
Go on, get in the car.

653
00:55:41,351 --> 00:55:43,135
- But I ordered onion rings.
- Doyle!

654
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:10,820
Stanley!

655
00:56:11,054 --> 00:56:12,723
What are you doing here?

656
00:56:12,976 --> 00:56:13,992
Yeah, hi!

657
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:19,583
I just wanted to come by and make sure
that you two got together all right.

658
00:56:19,661 --> 00:56:21,255
That's nice.

659
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:24,675
You know, I hardly ever stop by here.

660
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:28,137
It's kinda hard to believe it was just
a garbage heap.

661
00:56:28,298 --> 00:56:29,712
Yeah, it's...

662
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:35,436
It's really beautiful
right around sunset.

663
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,482
The methane emissions
really pick up the colours.

664
00:56:40,135 --> 00:56:43,653
All those pinks and greens.

665
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:53,162
My friend will be along here
any minute. I better go.

666
00:56:55,494 --> 00:56:56,833
Stanley, wait.

667
00:56:57,244 --> 00:56:58,533
Stanley?

668
00:56:58,682 --> 00:56:59,666
Stanley!

669
00:57:03,439 --> 00:57:04,799
Hello, chérie.

670
00:57:04,882 --> 00:57:06,926
We meet again!

671
00:57:07,009 --> 00:57:08,302
Is it fate?

672
00:57:08,386 --> 00:57:11,347
Is it meant to be?
It is written in the stars...

673
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:13,891
that we are destined to fraternize?

674
00:57:14,735 --> 00:57:16,811
I'd like to think so.

675
00:57:20,982 --> 00:57:25,611
Kiss me, my dear, and I will reveal
my croissant.

676
00:57:25,695 --> 00:57:31,265
I will spread your pâté. I will dip
my ladle in your vichyssoise.

677
00:57:35,329 --> 00:57:37,039
She is so coy.

678
00:57:37,213 --> 00:57:39,215
I love it.

679
00:57:45,047 --> 00:57:48,634
Our love is like a red, red rose.

680
00:57:48,843 --> 00:57:51,262
And I am a little thorny.

681
00:57:51,345 --> 00:57:53,848
Je t'adore! Je t'adore!

682
00:57:54,336 --> 00:57:56,463
Shoot the window. I don't care!

683
00:57:58,167 --> 00:58:00,730
This is Kellaway.
I need back-up and I need it now.

684
00:58:02,273 --> 00:58:03,608
Cigarette?

685
00:58:03,929 --> 00:58:04,632
No?

686
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,997
Now, like Napoleon...

687
00:58:18,196 --> 00:58:21,658
I will divide and conquer.

688
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:24,629
Ipkiss, police!

689
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:26,923
Merde.

690
00:58:26,964 --> 00:58:28,142
Freeze.

691
00:58:32,814 --> 00:58:34,055
Put your hands up.

692
00:58:34,447 --> 00:58:36,986
But you told me to freeze.

693
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:39,644
Alright, alright, unfreeze.

694
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:42,772
You're under arrest.

695
00:58:43,251 --> 00:58:45,608
No, it wasn't me.

696
00:58:45,767 --> 00:58:48,269
It was the one-armed man.

697
00:58:49,121 --> 00:58:50,873
Alright, I confess.

698
00:58:51,378 --> 00:58:54,757
I did it, you hear?
And I'm glad, glad, I tell you!

699
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:59,956
What are they going to do to me, Sarge?
What are they going to do?

700
00:59:00,366 --> 00:59:03,550
Sorry, son, that's not my department.

701
00:59:03,612 --> 00:59:04,822
Search him.

702
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,471
Where's a camcorder when you need one?

703
00:59:15,429 --> 00:59:18,766
Ah, looks like it's going to be a long night.
My wife's gonna kill me.

704
00:59:18,857 --> 00:59:22,485
- What is it, Murray?
- Cops got your pal Ipkiss taken at Landfill Park.

705
00:59:22,651 --> 00:59:26,321
Let me cover it, Murray. I really need
this story. You go home to Claire.

706
00:59:26,459 --> 00:59:28,682
Oh, I don't know. Tell you, Ramsey said...

707
00:59:29,213 --> 00:59:30,778
I will take care of Ramsey.

708
00:59:30,862 --> 00:59:32,572
Thanks a million, I owe you one.

709
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:36,200
Really big sunglasses...

710
00:59:36,284 --> 00:59:38,661
Bike horn...

711
00:59:38,884 --> 00:59:41,762
- Small-mouthed bass...
- Bowling pin...

712
00:59:44,577 --> 00:59:45,661
Mouse-trap...

713
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,251
Rubber chicken...

714
00:59:47,321 --> 00:59:50,711
- Little to the left. That's it.
- I don't know.

715
00:59:50,766 --> 00:59:52,216
Funny eyeball glasses...

716
00:59:52,524 --> 00:59:54,594
I've never seen those before in my life.

717
00:59:54,677 --> 00:59:56,846
- Bazooka.
- I have a permit for that.

718
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:59,849
- Picture of Kellaway's wife...
- What?

719
01:00:01,893 --> 01:00:04,978
Margaret! You son of a bitch!

720
01:00:05,057 --> 01:00:08,566
Geez, I figured you had a sense of humour.
After all...

721
01:00:08,766 --> 01:00:10,135
You married her!

722
01:00:12,556 --> 01:00:14,989
That's got to hurt.

723
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:16,489
Get him!

724
01:00:16,877 --> 01:00:18,033
Doyle!

725
01:00:40,092 --> 01:00:44,685
It's all over, Ipkiss. Put your hands
over your head or we'll open fire.

726
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:49,419

Give me that thing.

755
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,523
See you!

756
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:04,575
There he is! Let's get him. Snap out of it.
Come on, this dance is over!

757
01:03:04,659 --> 01:03:07,078
Let's go! Follow me, officers!

758
01:03:13,034 --> 01:03:17,163
He's down the alley. Follow me.
Come on. Grab your gun.

759
01:03:35,992 --> 01:03:37,258
Stanley!

Stanley, get in!

There he is!

762
01:03:44,198 --> 01:03:46,367
Halt, or I'll shoot!

763
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:49,920
Shoot! Shoot!

764
01:03:51,622 --> 01:03:53,207
Seat belts.

765
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:58,588
I missed him.

766
01:03:59,895 --> 01:04:02,565
Come on, we all missed him.

767
01:04:08,472 --> 01:04:10,266
I saw it.

768
01:04:11,212 --> 01:04:13,005
I saw everything.

769
01:04:13,895 --> 01:04:16,272
What's happening to you, Stanley?

770
01:04:18,649 --> 01:04:20,610
It's crazy.

771
01:04:24,947 --> 01:04:27,783
I'm losing control.

772
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:29,952
When I put that mask on...

773
01:04:30,036 --> 01:04:32,121
I can do anything.

774
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:35,238
Be anything.

775
01:04:38,284 --> 01:04:40,536
It's wrecking my life.

776
01:04:40,637 --> 01:04:42,965
My life is wrecked. Wrecked!

777
01:04:43,888 --> 01:04:44,904
Wrecked!

778
01:04:46,052 --> 01:04:49,096
Look, I don't know what's
happening to you, Stanley...

779
01:04:50,515 --> 01:04:52,850
but I do know this:

780
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:57,355
that letter you sent my column...

781
01:04:57,438 --> 01:05:00,399
that was from a guy with more guts...

782
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,277
and more heart...

783
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:06,697
than any of the creeps
that I've met in this city.

784
01:05:06,921 --> 01:05:09,966
Whatever that mask is...

785
01:05:10,049 --> 01:05:11,425
you don't need it.

786
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:13,579
You...

787
01:05:14,413 --> 01:05:16,791
Stanley Ipkiss...

788
01:05:16,874 --> 01:05:20,127
are already all you'll ever need to be.

789
01:05:24,382 --> 01:05:26,509
Gosh, Peg...

790
01:05:28,409 --> 01:05:30,160
do you really mean that?

791
01:05:31,573 --> 01:05:33,784
Actually...

792
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:34,859
no.

793
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:36,519
What?

794
01:05:38,695 --> 01:05:41,524
What took you guys so long? I've been
vamping here for like 20 minutes.

795
01:05:42,692 --> 01:05:43,651
Is this him?

796
01:05:44,429 --> 01:05:45,813
You got the 50 thou'?

797
01:05:46,711 --> 01:05:48,754
Give her the money.

798
01:05:51,912 --> 01:05:53,247
Right.

799
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,069
When he puts on the mask, he turns
into that green thingamajig.

800
01:05:56,345 --> 01:05:57,814
Maggie!

801
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,835
What are you doing?

802
01:06:01,175 --> 01:06:06,090
Sorry, Stanley. You really are a great guy,
I just can't lose my condo.

803
01:06:06,267 --> 01:06:09,311
You know how hard it is to find
an apartment in this city.

804
01:06:14,249 --> 01:06:15,875
You said you wouldn't hurt him!

805
01:06:18,926 --> 01:06:20,093
I lied.

806
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,417
Stanley!

807
01:06:39,878 --> 01:06:41,083
Tell me.

808
01:06:41,125 --> 01:06:42,585
How's this mask work?

809
01:06:43,402 --> 01:06:45,505
I don't know. You just...

810
01:06:46,631 --> 01:06:47,757
put it on.

811
01:07:00,707 --> 01:07:01,958
Boss...

812
01:07:02,647 --> 01:07:04,273
you better be careful, huh?

813
01:07:24,316 --> 01:07:26,443
What a rush.

814
01:07:27,672 --> 01:07:31,509
Whoa, boss! You okay?

815
01:07:32,593 --> 01:07:34,595
I'm better than ever, you idiot.

816
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:39,280
What do we do with Ipkiss?

817
01:07:41,388 --> 01:07:43,349
The police are looking for the Mask.

818
01:07:44,007 --> 01:07:46,216
So we'll give them the Mask.

819
01:07:56,325 --> 01:07:58,703
The money better be here, Ipkiss...

820
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,372
or you can Ip-kiss your ass goodbye.

821
01:08:08,412 --> 01:08:09,889
Hey Orlando.

822
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:49,915
Go!

823
01:09:01,766 --> 01:09:05,078
I still can't believe it. Hardened cops
dancing in the street...

824
01:09:05,109 --> 01:09:07,581
and broadcast all over the 11 o'clock news.

825
01:09:07,628 --> 01:09:10,487
- The SWAT team got an offer to open in Vegas.
- I'm history.

826
01:09:10,573 --> 01:09:14,354
The Captain's gonna have my badge
for breakfast with a little pension on top.

827
01:09:14,445 --> 01:09:18,976
Ah, come on, Lieutenant. It's not all
your fault. Something will turn up.

828
01:09:19,114 --> 01:09:22,785
Sure, Stanley Ipkiss is gonna fall
right into my lap.

829
01:09:29,152 --> 01:09:31,070
Get off! Get him off of me!

830
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:34,949
Just guess!

831
01:09:35,714 --> 01:09:36,759
Wait!

832
01:09:36,843 --> 01:09:38,594
I can explain everything.

833
01:09:38,678 --> 01:09:42,473
Oh yeah? You can explain everything?
Explain this!

834
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:47,177
Get him up! Come on! Let's go!
I got a cell for you, pal.

835
01:10:06,304 --> 01:10:07,265
Milo.

836
01:10:10,905 --> 01:10:12,170
Better forget about me, buddy.

837
01:10:12,901 --> 01:10:15,195
Find yourself a new place to live.

838
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:19,509
Looks like I'm gonna be in
here for a long, long time.

839
01:10:32,757 --> 01:10:34,593
Hey you, with the face.

840
01:10:35,617 --> 01:10:37,243
You got a visitor.

841
01:10:40,609 --> 01:10:41,578
Tina!

842
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:44,688
Hello, Stanley.

843
01:10:46,369 --> 01:10:48,955
- What are you doing here?
- Is it true?

844
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,374
You're the Mask.

845
01:10:52,712 --> 01:10:55,647
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
If I...

846
01:10:55,694 --> 01:11:00,881
get a good lawyer and strike up a deal,
I can be out of here in about 10,000 years.

847
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,701
You're taking a chance, coming here.

848
01:11:03,783 --> 01:11:06,327
Your boyfriend might be a little upset.

849
01:11:07,617 --> 01:11:11,747
He's going to the charity ball tonight.
He's gonna do something terrible.

850
01:11:11,991 --> 01:11:14,285
Like what? The Lambada?

851
01:11:14,776 --> 01:11:18,643
Stanley, this is serious. There's
gotta be a way to stop him.

852
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:20,860
How does it work?

853
01:11:21,191 --> 01:11:22,610
I don't know.

854
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:25,910
It's like...

855
01:11:25,993 --> 01:11:29,372
It's like it brings your
innermost desires to life.

856
01:11:29,595 --> 01:11:31,889
If deep down inside you're...

857
01:11:33,257 --> 01:11:36,344
a bit repressed and
a hopeless romantic...

858
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:38,859
you become some sort of a...

859
01:11:38,914 --> 01:11:41,133
love-crazy wild man.

860
01:11:41,295 --> 01:11:43,297
And if you're somebody like Dorian?

861
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:46,120
Then we're all in big trouble.

862
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:49,142
And if I were you,
I'd get out of town. Fast.

863
01:11:52,131 --> 01:11:53,382
Thanks.

864
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:55,546
For what?

865
01:11:55,759 --> 01:11:58,053
Lots of things.

866
01:12:01,459 --> 01:12:04,003
Sharing a sunset with me.

867
01:12:05,286 --> 01:12:09,426
For being the only guy who treated me
like a person, and not some sort of...

868
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:10,617
party favour.

869
01:12:14,035 --> 01:12:16,788
For being any kind of romantic...

870
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,668
even a hopeless one.

871
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:26,201
You're welcome.

872
01:12:26,261 --> 01:12:28,888
You know, that night at the club...

873
01:12:29,074 --> 01:12:32,035
I knew I'd found someone special.

874
01:12:34,546 --> 01:12:37,257
- The Mask.
- No.

875
01:12:37,538 --> 01:12:40,158
It was the guy inside the Mask.

876
01:12:40,327 --> 01:12:43,914
It was you all along.

877
01:12:44,929 --> 01:12:45,835
Stanley.

878
01:12:46,437 --> 01:12:47,351
Ip...

879
01:12:48,101 --> 01:12:49,101
kiss...

880
01:12:49,202 --> 01:12:51,871
Okay, lady, time's up.

881
01:12:52,063 --> 01:12:53,982
Could I have just...

882
01:12:54,104 --> 01:12:55,981
one more minute?

883
01:12:57,793 --> 01:13:00,129
I've got to disappear for
a while now, Stanley.

884
01:13:00,697 --> 01:13:04,367
I don't know where I'm gonna go,
but I'll let you know as soon as I can.

885
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:50,726
Somebody help me!

886
01:13:53,784 --> 01:13:54,831
No!

887
01:13:55,495 --> 01:13:58,410
Guard, guard, guard!

888
01:13:58,487 --> 01:14:00,398
There's a woman's being chased
through the alleyway there.

889
01:14:00,559 --> 01:14:02,478
Come on! She needs help.

890
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:05,209
Yeah, yeah, sure. Keep it down, Ipkiss.

891
01:14:05,434 --> 01:14:08,186
Come on! Serve and protect, man!

892
01:14:19,709 --> 01:14:20,740
Milo!

893
01:14:24,022 --> 01:14:24,873
Milo?

894
01:14:28,553 --> 01:14:31,256
Milo! Good boy. Come on. Come on.

895
01:14:33,341 --> 01:14:35,551
Jump up. Come on! Can you jump up?

896
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:40,049
Remember how I taught you not to
jump up on people? Forget all that.

897
01:14:40,077 --> 01:14:42,377
Okay. Come on! Come here.

898
01:14:44,387 --> 01:14:46,535
Get up. Get up here!

899
01:14:47,238 --> 01:14:49,530
Get up. Get up here. That's it.

900
01:14:49,708 --> 01:14:52,168
You can do it. Come on. Come on!

901
01:14:52,669 --> 01:14:53,871
Come on!

902
01:14:53,911 --> 01:14:55,606
Come on! Milo!

903
01:14:55,807 --> 01:14:57,308
Put some effort into it!

904
01:15:14,305 --> 01:15:16,766
Baby, there you are.

905
01:15:16,976 --> 01:15:19,366
I was beginning to get all worried about you.

906
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:23,100
- Nice little talk with the cops?
- I just went to see what Ipkiss told them.

907
01:15:23,162 --> 01:15:27,208
Oh, that's right, you and Stanley right?
You two are getting awfully close.

908
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:30,240
Maybe it was you who helped
him out with the bank job.

909
01:15:30,313 --> 01:15:33,107
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it?

910
01:15:34,403 --> 01:15:36,906
Look what I found in her car.

911
01:15:38,889 --> 01:15:40,748
You planning a little
trip without me, baby?

912
01:15:41,132 --> 01:15:42,062
No?

913
01:15:44,277 --> 01:15:46,404
Boys, I want you to...

914
01:15:46,503 --> 01:15:48,964
pick her out something
pretty to wear, okay?

915
01:15:51,291 --> 01:15:54,086
We're going to go to a party tonight.

916
01:15:54,143 --> 01:15:56,896
We're going to have one hell
of a time, aren't we? Yes.

917
01:15:58,307 --> 01:15:59,809
Get out of my sight.

918
01:16:01,165 --> 01:16:02,583
Jump up.

919
01:16:02,614 --> 01:16:03,823
Get up. Come on.

920
01:16:05,921 --> 01:16:08,757
Come on, Milo. Jump, please.

921
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:11,085
Do it for Daddy.

922
01:16:14,448 --> 01:16:16,284
That's it!

923
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,329
God, I can't believe it.

924
01:16:21,789 --> 01:16:24,500
Good boy. Good boy.

925
01:16:28,087 --> 01:16:29,505
See that man over there?

926
01:16:29,773 --> 01:16:31,400
He's got keys.

927
01:16:31,852 --> 01:16:32,868
Yeah.

928
01:16:33,027 --> 01:16:34,862
Go get those keys.

929
01:16:34,907 --> 01:16:37,535
Go get them. Go get the keys. Go get them.

930
01:16:40,015 --> 01:16:40,974
That's it.

931
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:42,094
Yeah.

932
01:16:42,593 --> 01:16:43,636
Get the key.

933
01:16:47,765 --> 01:16:49,148
No, not...

934
01:16:49,402 --> 01:16:51,612
Not the cheese, the keys.

935
01:16:53,696 --> 01:16:55,615
Put the cheese down...

936
01:16:57,267 --> 01:16:58,727
and get the keys. Go on!

937
01:16:58,794 --> 01:17:01,422
Over there, over there.

938
01:17:15,774 --> 01:17:17,032
Yeah!

939
01:17:17,148 --> 01:17:19,289
Oh, man. Come on.

940
01:17:19,336 --> 01:17:21,755
Come here. Good boy.

941
01:17:21,836 --> 01:17:23,469
That's a good boy.

942
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:24,789
Good boy.

943
01:17:25,438 --> 01:17:28,064
Give it. Give it, give me the keys.
Give me the keys.

944
01:17:28,105 --> 01:17:30,556
Come on, come on, drop it, drop it.

945
01:17:30,611 --> 01:17:31,181
Drop it!

946
01:17:31,227 --> 01:17:33,117
It's sundown.

947
01:17:33,154 --> 01:17:34,989
It's almost time.

948
01:17:36,936 --> 01:17:38,855
I wouldn't do that, darling.

949
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:45,244
Wouldn't want to start the
celebration early, would you?

950
01:18:26,672 --> 01:18:27,711
Milo!

951
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,418
Hold it!

952
01:18:30,501 --> 01:18:32,495
I am warning you, I'm...

953
01:18:32,549 --> 01:18:34,630
seriously stressed out here.

954
01:18:34,883 --> 01:18:36,093
Easy, Ipkiss.

955
01:18:36,118 --> 01:18:37,884
Come on.

956
01:18:37,967 --> 01:18:39,302
Don't be an idiot.

957
01:18:39,343 --> 01:18:43,973
You're in the middle of a police station. There is no
way you're walking out of here like this.

958
01:18:45,516 --> 01:18:47,143
You're know, you're right.

959
01:18:49,812 --> 01:18:52,648
- You're absolutely right.
- What the hell are you doing?

960
01:18:53,941 --> 01:18:55,568
You're gonna take me out...

961
01:18:55,651 --> 01:18:57,403
as your prisoner.

962
01:18:57,487 --> 01:19:00,198
Put it on! Put it on!

963
01:19:01,782 --> 01:19:03,034
Come on.

964
01:19:03,117 --> 01:19:06,312
- I'm really very sorry about this.
- I'm sure. Milo!

965
01:19:09,007 --> 01:19:10,658
You got the wrong guy, I tell you!

966
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:12,347
It's a bum rap.

967
01:19:12,397 --> 01:19:13,920
I got my rights!

968
01:19:14,003 --> 01:19:15,963
Hey, Lieutenant. Where
are you taking Ipkiss?

969
01:19:16,078 --> 01:19:19,122
Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay.

970
01:19:19,526 --> 01:19:22,637
I get it. Pig Latin, right?

971
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,680
Eesay ouyay aterlay.

972
01:19:26,057 --> 01:19:27,225
Come on!

973
01:19:34,899 --> 01:19:37,485
Why don't you just sit back and relax?

974
01:19:39,974 --> 01:19:42,435
I've got to change for the party.

975
01:20:14,397 --> 01:20:15,631
I need a pack of cigarettes.

976
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:17,733
- Which brand, sir?
- It doesn't matter, I don't smoke.

977
01:20:17,817 --> 01:20:20,611
But for you, I would shoot
the Surgeon General.

978
01:20:21,988 --> 01:20:23,990
Mayor Tilton, may we have a word with you?

979
01:20:24,073 --> 01:20:28,411
Well, I always have time for the
press and my loyal constituents.

980
01:21:04,655 --> 01:21:07,241
Let me out of these cuffs, Ipkiss,
you're driving like a maniac.

981
01:21:07,318 --> 01:21:09,498
I'm sorry, we're already late for the ball.

982
01:21:09,537 --> 01:21:12,630
Right. Alice and the white rabbit
are gonna be really disappointed.

983
01:21:12,692 --> 01:21:14,318
Now you're being cynical.

984
01:21:17,084 --> 01:21:18,677
Who the hell are you?

985
01:21:18,732 --> 01:21:21,396
I'm just an ex-employee...

986
01:21:21,447 --> 01:21:24,033
who has come for his back pay.

987
01:21:24,101 --> 01:21:26,478
Or should I say payback?

988
01:21:27,484 --> 01:21:28,343
Dorian?

989
01:21:30,139 --> 01:21:31,557
Kill him.

990
01:21:50,833 --> 01:21:52,168
Come on.

991
01:22:14,058 --> 01:22:15,518
Ladies and gentlemen...

992
01:22:16,425 --> 01:22:19,772
I will be your host
for the remainder of the evening.

993
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,623
Ipkiss, get your dog away from me.

994
01:22:34,245 --> 01:22:36,289
I'm sorry, he seems to be attracted to you.

995
01:22:36,372 --> 01:22:39,582
Wait a minute. Where is everybody?
Something's not kosher here.

996
01:22:39,635 --> 01:22:40,926
- Exactly.
- Watch it!

997
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:42,044
I'm sorry.

998
01:22:42,128 --> 01:22:43,588
I'm gonna have to lock you in.

999
01:22:45,081 --> 01:22:47,487
- Use the radio.
- What?

1000
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:50,876
You know, call for backup
or something.

1001
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:52,363
Milo.

1002
01:22:53,065 --> 01:22:56,694
This could be dangerous.
You stay here and be a good boy.

1003
01:22:57,727 --> 01:23:00,480
Daddy's gonna have to go kick some ass.

1004
01:23:05,193 --> 01:23:06,652
He's a dead man.

1005
01:23:06,736 --> 01:23:07,943
Down! Get down!

1006
01:23:08,115 --> 01:23:09,318
Come on, come on!

1007
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:11,490
Come on! Line 'em up over here.

1008
01:23:11,544 --> 01:23:13,409
Take it easy, I got the point.

1009
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:26,158
Blow it!

1010
01:23:34,055 --> 01:23:35,078
Bastard.

1011
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,809
What's the matter, darling?

1012
01:23:37,892 --> 01:23:40,437
This is your big production number.

1013
01:23:40,492 --> 01:23:44,857
And you know it's important
to go out with a big bang.

1014
01:23:51,312 --> 01:23:52,281
Charlie!

1015
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:55,618
What are you doing here?

1016
01:23:56,163 --> 01:23:59,428
Look, take this gun and start
sneaking people out the back.

1017
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:00,600
Right.

1018
01:24:03,485 --> 01:24:04,602
You two step back.

1019
01:24:04,627 --> 01:24:08,005
- You don't know who you're talking to, do you?
- I'm talking to a dead man if you don't step back like I said.

1020
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:10,276
Hey! Don't you have respect
for law and order?

1021
01:24:10,324 --> 01:24:13,534
- What kind of thug are you?
- It's all set, Dorian.

1022
01:24:14,846 --> 01:24:16,639
That's it.

1023
01:24:17,974 --> 01:24:19,976
This party's over...

1024
01:24:20,059 --> 01:24:21,978
in 10 minutes.

1025
01:24:23,855 --> 01:24:26,128
This is the moment of truth...

1026
01:24:26,192 --> 01:24:28,444
when a man shows what
he's really made of.

1027
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:30,820
Crap.

1028
01:24:30,871 --> 01:24:32,665
Drop it, Ipkiss.

1029
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:47,033
Smart dog.

1030
01:24:52,967 --> 01:24:56,554
Hey Boss, look who decided to crash
the party.

1031
01:24:56,761 --> 01:24:59,055
Hi Dorian! How's it going?

1032
01:24:59,421 --> 01:25:01,732
- Bring him up here!
- Dorian!

1033
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:04,270
Dorian, wait! No!

1034
01:25:04,353 --> 01:25:07,940
It's no time for last requests.

1035
01:25:08,024 --> 01:25:10,526
But all I wanted was a kiss.

1036
01:25:11,226 --> 01:25:12,945
A kiss?

1037
01:25:13,702 --> 01:25:17,074
Just one last kiss.

1038
01:25:17,314 --> 01:25:19,191
Dorian, I can't shut this thing off.

1039
01:25:20,244 --> 01:25:22,830
There's always time...

1040
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:26,792
for one last kiss.

1041
01:25:31,756 --> 01:25:33,966
From the real Dorian.

1042
01:25:35,176 --> 01:25:37,595
The one I used to love.

1043
01:25:38,971 --> 01:25:41,057
Nobody ever kissed me
like Dorian Tyrel.

1044
01:25:42,276 --> 01:25:43,193
Romeo!

1045
01:25:43,434 --> 01:25:45,745
This whole place is gonna
blow in a couple of minutes!

1046
01:25:45,798 --> 01:25:48,050
Just wait!

1047
01:25:52,109 --> 01:25:54,070
I've decided...

1048
01:26:02,453 --> 01:26:04,789
to give her one last thrill.

1049
01:26:15,633 --> 01:26:17,135
Get it!

1050
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:35,884
Run, Milo!

1051
01:26:39,323 --> 01:26:41,868
Stanley, hurry!

1052
01:26:41,951 --> 01:26:43,536
Don't worry, Tina.

1053
01:26:43,619 --> 01:26:45,413
It's all over now.

1054
01:26:49,142 --> 01:26:50,205
Stanley!

1055
01:26:56,535 --> 01:26:57,536
Got you.

1056
01:27:10,486 --> 01:27:12,071
I'm gonna take you apart.

1057
01:27:12,553 --> 01:27:15,947
Well I hope you can enjoy the victory
with one freaking eye!

1058
01:27:33,942 --> 01:27:35,161
Good doggie.

1059
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:36,600
Good doggie.

1060
01:27:56,376 --> 01:27:57,336
I'm winning!

1061
01:28:02,213 --> 01:28:03,259
Stanley?

1062
01:28:10,205 --> 01:28:11,119
Stanley!

1063
01:28:23,018 --> 01:28:23,908
Yeah!

1064
01:28:32,026 --> 01:28:33,143
Milo!

1065
01:28:35,731 --> 01:28:37,733
Oh, my God!

1066
01:28:37,817 --> 01:28:39,986
This has gotta be a new breed.

1067
01:28:40,069 --> 01:28:41,529
Easy, boy!

1068
01:28:45,449 --> 01:28:46,492
Good boy!

1069
01:29:17,444 --> 01:29:19,238
Did you miss me?

1070
01:29:27,034 --> 01:29:28,464
I guess not!

1071
01:29:35,243 --> 01:29:38,557
Now, you have to ask yourself
one question:

1072
01:29:38,586 --> 01:29:41,130
"Do I feel lucky?"

1073
01:29:41,214 --> 01:29:42,173
Well...

1074
01:29:44,926 --> 01:29:46,552
Do you...

1075
01:29:46,636 --> 01:29:48,304
punks?

1076
01:30:00,352 --> 01:30:01,407
Stanley!

1077
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:25,912
That's a spicy meatball.

1078
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:35,316
How do?

1079
01:30:41,607 --> 01:30:44,152
This guy's incorrigible.

1080
01:31:12,054 --> 01:31:14,265
You were good, kid, real good...

1081
01:31:14,348 --> 01:31:17,935
but as long as I'm around, you'll
always be second-best, see?

1082
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:40,935
Police! Hands up!

1083
01:31:42,126 --> 01:31:44,670
Officers, arrest those men.

1084
01:31:45,474 --> 01:31:47,340
I've always wanted to say that.

1085
01:31:50,384 --> 01:31:51,511
Come on.

1086
01:31:52,887 --> 01:31:54,263
Give me that gun.

1087
01:32:00,061 --> 01:32:03,189
He stole all our jewellery.
Take me down to headquarters...

1088
01:32:03,272 --> 01:32:05,139
Stop that man!

1089
01:32:05,194 --> 01:32:06,342
Ipkiss!

1090
01:32:08,337 --> 01:32:09,603
I've got you now, Ipkiss.

1091
01:32:09,654 --> 01:32:11,739
Watch it, Chunky!

1092
01:32:11,970 --> 01:32:14,784
- Mayor Tilton, I'm so...
- What the hell is wrong with you, Kellaway?

1093
01:32:14,867 --> 01:32:16,619
That man is the Mask.

1094
01:32:16,661 --> 01:32:20,748
No. Dorian Tyrel was the Mask.
I saw it with my own eyes.

1095
01:32:20,832 --> 01:32:22,959
This young man here just saved our lives.

1096
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,566
- With a little help from his friends.
- You're a real hero.

1097
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:26,543
Doyle!

1098
01:32:26,963 --> 01:32:28,806
Well, it's nothing...

1099
01:32:28,884 --> 01:32:30,758
any American with...

1100
01:32:30,842 --> 01:32:34,137
balls of steel wouldn't do
for his community.

1101
01:32:34,178 --> 01:32:36,305
Milo! Come on.

1102
01:32:37,586 --> 01:32:41,000
Hey, wait, that dog!
Mayor Tilton, did you see that dog?

1103
01:32:41,062 --> 01:32:43,729
Leave the dog alone.

1104
01:32:43,813 --> 01:32:46,482
I want to see you in my office
first thing tomorrow.

1105
01:32:46,566 --> 01:32:49,694
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Boy, that doesn't sound good at all.

1106
01:32:49,777 --> 01:32:53,322
No, it doesn't sound good.
What would sound good to you?

1107
01:32:53,406 --> 01:32:55,658
- Breakfast.
- Shut up!

1108
01:33:15,178 --> 01:33:17,138
You sure you know what you're doing, buddy?

1109
01:33:19,557 --> 01:33:21,476
I'm sure.

1110
01:33:21,559 --> 01:33:23,519
Then do what you gotta do.

1111
01:33:36,741 --> 01:33:38,951
Sure you're not gonna miss this guy?

1112
01:33:39,035 --> 01:33:42,371
When he's gone, all that's left is me.

1113
01:34:20,119 --> 01:34:21,057
Milo!

1114
01:34:26,791 --> 01:34:28,876
Smoking!
