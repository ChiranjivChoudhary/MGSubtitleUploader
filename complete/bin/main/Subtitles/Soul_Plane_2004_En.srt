I'm sorry, sir.

1
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,907
Your dog is too big
to be on the plane.

1
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,991
You'll have to check him.

1
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,911
Wait. No. I usually
just put him in my bag.

1
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:00,120
He's not that big.

1
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:03,374
Those are the rules.
You'll have to check your dog.

1

Or consider taking
another airline.

- Russ.

I can't just...

1
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:17,554
Come on, Dre.

1
00:03:17,638 --> 00:03:19,139
- Come on.
- Don't worry, sir.

1
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:21,350
- We'll take good care of him.
- Please do.

1
00:03:21,392 --> 00:03:23,060
That's my little boy right there.

1
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:24,478
See you when I get off.

Chicken, I'll have the chicken.

Thank you.
Excuse me.

1
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,102
- It smells good, though.
- Chicken or beef stroganoff?

1
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:07,479
I'm gonna have the chicken.
I like the way that smelled.

1
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,648
That was our last chicken.

1
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:11,108
I'm afraid
I just have stroganoff.

1
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:13,235
So why would you ask me
what I wanted?

1
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,032
What's in that?

1
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:19,491
Stroganoff.

1
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,711
That beef strogie.
That wasn't half bad.

1
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:32,421
It was good.

1
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:34,757
Almost got a little spit on you.

1
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,216
- Yes, you did.
- I'm sorry.

Are you all right, sir?

1
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:49,313

1
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:50,898
- Straight down.
- Where?

Damn! Oh, shit!

1
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:12,628
So loose.

1
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:18,092

it was gonna be like that.

That should get him loose.

00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:57,024
You don't treat people
like this.

1

What exactly
is your occupation, Nashawn?

1
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:10,788
- I'm an entrepreneur.
- I see.

1
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,915
So I guess it's fair to say
you don't have a job.

1
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:14,792
No, I do...

Any of 'em
ever make any money?

00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,468
- No.
- Exactly.

1
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,929
So it would be correct to say
that you're nothin' more

1
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:29,598
than a deadbeat

1
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:41,068
Be brief.

1

00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:57,241
Four tickets for flight 069
on NWA.

1
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,286
What you're going to want to do
is go to Gate One...

1
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:05,374
That's Terminal X... and we'll send
your luggage on down for you.

1
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:07,918
- Thank you for your help.
- You're quite welcome.

1
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,545
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:10,963
Hey, sweetie.

1
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:13,340
Don't get it greasy.
It's very expensive.

1
00:12:13,424 --> 00:12:15,050
I know, I bought it.

1
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:18,637
Now, a gentleman always
carries a lady's bags.

1
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:21,640
- So why are you carrying hers?
- Be kind, son.

1
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:24,893
If I play my cards right,
she'll be your future mother figure.

1
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:26,312
That's scary.

1
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:28,647
Ooh, hey, sweetie.
Wait a minute.

1
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:31,358
Don't look back
and not say anything.

1
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,068
Excuse me.
You got to move, lady.

1
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,112
Baby, come here.
Gimme a second.

1
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:37,364
Girl, you must not know
who I am.

1
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:40,409
Nashawn Wade, baby.
I own NWA. The boss.

1
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:42,494
Where the hell is Terminal X?

1
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:46,081
Relax, honey. Didn't we just have
a great vacation in Crackerland?

1
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:50,044
No, we didn't...
Give me that stupid hat. Leave it!

1
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:53,088
You know what would've
been great? Going to Hawaii alone.

1
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,548
Listen, you know the deal.

1
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:56,634
I only get to see my kids
every other weekend.

1
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,470
Billy, where's your sister?

1
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:01,639
She's that way.

1
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:04,308
Great.

1
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:10,439
Heather, you can't just
walk away from the family.

1
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:13,192
If you want to go somewhere,
you gotta ask permission first.

1
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:15,778
Dad, I'm 18 years old.

1
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,238
Sorry.

1
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:20,324
She's 17. You are 17.

1
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:24,662
Fine. For a couple more hours.
I am 17, and then I'll be 18.

1
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:26,205
Then I can party and have sex.

1
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:28,249
- Sex?! No, no.
- Yeah, sex.

1
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:31,043
Missionary, doggie-style,
rockin' the baby,

1
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,086
gettin' tea-bagged,

1
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:34,922
playin' the trombone
while I'm tossin' his salad,

1
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:37,967
hand jobs, ear jobs,
blow jobs.

1
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:41,303
Gettin' a Pearl necklace,
ridin' the bologna pony...

1
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:43,180
- sucking...
- That's enough!

1
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,099
- Did she say bologna?
- I don't know.

1
00:13:45,182 --> 00:13:47,810
Whenever I want, and best of all,
I won't have to listen to you.

1
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:52,731
Can you believe that?

1
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:56,527
What came after
getting tea-bagged?

1
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:58,028
Something about the trombone.

1
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,074
Okay, everybody,
congratulations!

1
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,368
You guys have been punk'd!

1
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:06,704
There's cameras everywhere,
right, son?

1
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:09,456
We'll be back in five minutes
with the release forms.

1
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,041
Let's go.

1
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:20,384
Oh, shit! Awesome!

1
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:26,974
- Terminal Malcolm X?
- Yeah.

1
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,396
Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
Usually you gotta go to two places,

1
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:34,899
- but there you get the one...
- This is a terminal?

1
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:37,902
It's great, 99 cents. Everything.

1
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,196
Oh, check out the car.

1
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:45,701
This place has every...
There's a basketball court.

1
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,580
In your face!

1
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:53,459
Get your short ass on,
you leprechaun.

1
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,210
Look like my ex...
Short and stupid.

1
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:56,587
Everything's short.

1
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,172
I don't know about all that,

1
00:14:58,255 --> 00:15:01,884
but if Denzel walked his fine
sexy ass in here right now,

1
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,594
I'm takin' the rest of the day off

1
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:06,639
and gettin' straight down
with the get down.

1
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:07,765
You know what I'm sayin'?

1
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,350
Girl, let me tell you,
Denzel is nice,

1
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:10,601
but I like the young thugs.

1
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:13,646
I love me some 50 Cent, baby.

1
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:16,232
Ooh, Shaniece. Go, Shaniece!

1
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,108
It's your birthday.

1
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,110
We gonna party
like it's your birthday.

1
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:22,112
Sip Bacardi
like it's my birthday.

1
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,448
And you know we don't
give a fuck it's not my birthday!

1
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,953
Look at this little nigga here.

1
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,788
Look more like five cent.

1
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,082
Nigga, can't you read?

1
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:36,001
The sign says put
all metal objects in the container.

1
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:38,587
Take your ass off.
Get on back there!

1
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:39,755
Get your ass back there.

1
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,548
Cheap ass.

1
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:45,094
Shit goin' off 'cause that shit cheap.
That's why it's goin' off.

1
00:15:45,219 --> 00:15:47,429
My flow, my show
bought me the dough

1
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:49,723
that bought me
all my fancy things.

1
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:51,892
My cribs, my cars,
my pools, my jewels.

1
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:53,811
Nigga, I done came up
and I ain't changed.

1
00:15:57,064 --> 00:15:58,190
Hold it!

1
00:15:58,274 --> 00:16:00,442
You keep fuckin' up
on my rhymes.

1
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:02,820
Move it along, nickel.

1
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:06,865
You wanna say somethin'?!

1
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,993
I ain't slapped a bitch
in two weeks.

1
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:10,578
Yeah, I got a whole lot
of strength

1
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:12,162
in the slap-a-bitch arm.

1
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:19,336
They had a whole bunch of dirty
magazines... bathing suit issues.

1
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,590
Damn! So you like that, huh?
You gonna love this.

1
00:16:22,673 --> 00:16:25,968
Hold those for me, I won't be
needing those on this flight.

1
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,344
Girl, what you got me...

1
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,060
The sweet smell of Alizé.

1
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:40,065
- Hunkee? Elvis Hunkee?
- Yeah.

1
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:43,360
Karl Malone? I used to play
basketball with you in high school.

1
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:46,864
That's right. We used to call you
"The Paperboy."

1
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:49,241
Yeah, that was then.
I'm "The Mailman" now.

1
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:50,326
That's good.

1
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:53,412
My dad's a mailman, too.
Government jobs pay very well.

1
00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:55,414
You don't understand,
I play for the Lakers now.

1
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:58,083
Right, Karl. I don't think
you understand.

1
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,502
I used to play with you, man.
You can't shoot, remember?

1
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:02,171
That's why we never
passed you the ball.

1
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:04,298
I thought it was because
I was the only brother.

1
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,425
No, Karl. It's 'cause you sucked!

1
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:07,509
Oh, I sucked?

1
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:10,888
What are you gonna do...
Go all "postal" on me, Mr. Mailman?

1
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:13,724
My man, what's goin' on, baby?

1
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,477
Ah, that's nice.
That's real nice.

1
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:23,025
I'd like to be them jeans.
Make no sense.

1
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:28,822
Excuse me.
How you doin', man?

1
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,824
Can I get through here,
sweetie?

1
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:32,952
What's goin' on, fellas?
My man.

1
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:37,873
When the buzzer pop, nigga,
you stop!

1
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,960
Do y'all know who I am?

1
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:44,338
We don't give a damn
about who you are.

1
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:46,674
Let your little ass
take one more step...

1
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:50,219
we'll bury your ass in them fake-ass
iguana shoes you're wearin'.

1
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:55,057
Ladies, it's me. It's Nashawn Wade,
owner of this airline.

1
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:56,600
Come on, remember.
I hired y'all.

1
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,601
- It's him.
- There ya go.

1
00:17:57,726 --> 00:18:00,354
That's a little more like it.
Thought you had amnesia.

1
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:02,439
Yes, it is him!

1
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:05,109
You that little nigga got his ass
caught in a toilet seat.

1
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,995
All right, little player, go on, take
your little cute rich ass on through.

1
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:17,413
Go ahead, little player.

1
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:19,248
Bet that ass still tight,
ain't it?

1
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,961
Shit, bitch. I hope we don't lose
our benefits over this.

1
00:18:24,044 --> 00:18:26,088
We sorry, Mr. Wade!

1
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,756
My tooth is hurtin'.

1
00:18:27,881 --> 00:18:29,800
And it's fuckin'
with your breath, girl.

1
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,510
Upsettin' all my insides here.

1
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:33,262
Don't you say shit else
for a year.

1
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:35,306
You done melted the whole side...

1
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,349
That's what you get
for fuckin' us up.

1
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:48,527
I'll tell ya, I knew I shoulda got
the new Aerostar.

1
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:50,446
Check out the safety rating.

1
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:52,489
I'm a little nervous.

1
00:18:52,573 --> 00:18:55,367
I heard someone say
this is the first flight for this airline.

1
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:56,827
It has five cup holders.

1
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:59,955
Honey, the FAA, they're very strict
about who they let fly an airline.

1
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,332
It's gonna be okay, believe me.

1
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,668
Yeah, I know, but I think we're
the only white people on the plane.

1
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,253
Girlfriend, like your bag.

1
00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:07,338
Honey, no, we're not.

1
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:09,423
You ain't gonna pick me up?!

1
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:14,011
Maybe it's a coincidence,
you know, like a family reunion?

1
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,387
Million Man March?

1
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:36,659
Hey, what are you...
Hey, stop that!

1
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,708
Yeah, what up, son?

1
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:48,045
Yeah, yeah.
You know I'm like that.

1
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,296
I'm like that.

1
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,589
Damn. What up?

1
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:53,801
Here's your card, Dad.
I think I melted the sucka.

1
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:55,511
Put everything on it
but an Escalade.

1
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,430
I'm a holler at the shorty
I saw at the basketball courts.

1
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,892
One love, dawg.

1
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:04,603
Where's my son?

1
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:11,151
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

1
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:13,654
You doin' good?
You feel wonderful.

1
00:20:13,737 --> 00:20:17,700
- Yeah. All right.
- Hey. Whoa! That's my zipper!

1
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:20,828
And that's too loud
for a zipper.

1
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:22,746
I don't know
what you got in there,

1
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,290
but we gonna find out.

1
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:27,501
- I got a plane to catch.
- Come with me.

1
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,715
Did you hear me, boy?!

1
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:37,845
I bet you ain't never seen
a chocolate super-deluxe woman

1
00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:38,971
like me before.

1
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,223
Have you?

1
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:46,937
No, I got a plane to catch.
I gotta go!

1
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:51,692
Where do you think
you're goin', player?

1
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:52,902
I'm gonna get on...

1
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:56,864
We feds now,
which means I can violate

1
00:20:56,947 --> 00:21:00,993
every last one
of your civil rights.

1
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:04,079
Now drop them drawers...
Denzel.

1
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:07,541
Denzel? Look, lady.
I just want...

1
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,460
Drop them drawers!

1
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,504
Show me that ass, nigga!

1
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:15,132
Now turn around.

1
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:18,093
Cavity check!

1
00:21:31,315 --> 00:21:33,776
Girl, there was duct tape
and peanut butter everywhere.

1
00:21:33,817 --> 00:21:37,196
I told him, I don't care
if you are a diplomat.

1
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,906
I don't bend into that position.

1
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:41,825
Girl, I ain't no circus freak.
This ain't Cirque du Soleil.

1
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,080
He's a fool.

1
00:21:46,163 --> 00:21:48,165
Mi vida,
you did the right thing.

1
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:49,667
Mi primo tried that once.

1
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,544
The doctors still can't find
his left nut.

1
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:54,296
They say it's up there
somewhere.

1
00:21:54,338 --> 00:21:57,132
Give me his address.
I'll find it.

1
00:21:58,676 --> 00:22:00,052
Hey, Muggsy!

1
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:01,637
Flame, not now.

1
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:05,182
Where's the pilots
you hired, man?

1
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:07,226
- Come on, dawg...
- It's not come on now.

1
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:09,603
We're supposed to take off
in 20 minutes.

1
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:10,896
Calm down, Little Bow-Wow.

1
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,064
He'll be here, all right?

1
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:14,775
- There he go right there.
- Who, him?

1
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:16,068
- Yeah, him.
- Right there?

1
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:17,236
- Right there.
- Him?

1
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:22,616
- Him right there?
- Yeah, him right there.

1
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:30,207
I told you to hire
a black pilot,

1
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,251
not no black baggage handler.
What is that?

1
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:34,795
I did what
you asked me to, okay?

1
00:22:34,878 --> 00:22:36,630
There ain't but two
black pilots around,

1
00:22:36,714 --> 00:22:38,090
and one of 'em flyin' for Puffy.

1
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:39,174
How'd Puffy get that one?

1
00:22:39,216 --> 00:22:41,969
- Don't worry.
- You're right, I'm just nervous.

1
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:46,473
I got his resumé right there.
My dawg, what's up, baby?

1
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:48,851
What's goin' on, Muggs?
How you been?

1
00:22:48,893 --> 00:22:49,977
What's up, man?

1
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,396
- How are you, man?
- Ain't nothin' to it but do it.

1
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:54,690
Nashawn, Captain Mack.
Captain Mack, Nashawn.

1
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,108
My pleasure, brother.

1
00:22:56,191 --> 00:22:57,359
Hey. You're late, man.

1
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,361
Don't worry about me bein' late.

1
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:02,781
I'm gonna take this hooptie of yours
up another 1,000 feet,

1
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:06,535
catch me a slipstream, and we
gonna be there five minutes early.

1
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,580
Real slick like hair grease,
but with less mess.

1
00:23:09,663 --> 00:23:12,082
- Can you dig it?
- Hell, yeah, I can dig it.

1
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,417
You really gonna do that?

1
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,419
No, I'm just fuckin' with ya.

1
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:20,007
Y'all two know each other?
He was fuckin' with me.

1
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,760
Muggs, I'm really
not playin' right now.

1
00:23:22,843 --> 00:23:24,345
I'm not, Muggs.

1
00:23:24,428 --> 00:23:25,971
I was lookin' at
your resumé, man.

1
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:27,556
I see that you flew
in Desert Storm.

1
00:23:27,598 --> 00:23:29,934
- That's pretty impressive.
- Actually, that's a typo.

1
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,185
I drew over in Desert Storm.

1
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:33,103
I'm sorry. I didn't...
What you say?

1
00:23:33,187 --> 00:23:35,773
I was the nigga that drew
the little sayings on the bombs:

1
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:38,692
"Fuck Iraq." "Saddam, eat a dick."
That was me.

1
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:39,902
Secret agent.

1
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,446
Matter of fact, I ain't even
'posed to be talkin' about that.

1
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:43,530
That's classified.

1
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:46,784
What the fuck?! Do you even
know how to fly a plane, man?

1
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:48,494
I got my wings when I got out.

1
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:50,079
Got your wings
when you got out?

1
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,375
You right. Plus I ain't really got
another choice right now.

1
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:56,585
Where's your uniform?

1
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:57,836
You lookin' at it.

1
00:23:57,962 --> 00:23:59,672
The Mackin' is crackin'.
This is how I come.

1
00:23:59,797 --> 00:24:01,131
I don't wear no square suits.

1
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:03,133
I'm a player.
We ride spinners.

1
00:24:03,217 --> 00:24:05,594
Ride spinners
and you write on bombs.

1
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:07,054
That's classified.

1
00:24:07,137 --> 00:24:08,472
I'm gonna tell you what.

1
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:11,350
Get us there safe.
Can you do that?

1
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:13,811
You somethin' else, Muggs.
Drew on bombs.

1
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:16,313
- Excuse me, man,
- Yes, sir.

1
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,940
That's about a bitch.

1
00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:20,025
- Where the cockpit at?
- You got that bong?

1
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:22,570
Whole bag of it, Preach.

1
00:24:22,653 --> 00:24:24,738
- I gotta go.
- Do I pay you to talk on the phone?

1
00:24:24,822 --> 00:24:26,991
Look at the captain.
He is too cute.

1
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:32,162
Hi, Captain.

1
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:35,332
- At ease, ladies.
- Hi, fly boy.

1
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:37,251
I just love the look
of a man in uniform.

1
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:41,630
'Course, I like the look of a man
out of uniform even better.

1
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:48,804
This is some cool shit
fit for a real nigga.

1
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,599
Hey, what's poppin',
my aeronautical hustlers?

1
00:24:51,682 --> 00:24:53,183
Captain Mack,
reporting to duty.

1
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:55,352
How you doin'. Captain?
I'm Riggs. Your flight engineer.

1
00:24:55,436 --> 00:24:56,604
Have you ever met Gaeman?

1
00:24:56,687 --> 00:24:59,815
I just seen one of them
fruity motherfuckers in the hallway.

1
00:24:59,857 --> 00:25:01,442
Nigga was eyeballin' me.

1
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:04,653
It's Gaeman, I am Leslie Gaeman,
your copilot.

1
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:05,988
What's happenin'?

1
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,198
It's a very prestigious
African name...

1
00:25:08,324 --> 00:25:11,702
Not like "gay man,"
two men fucking together, naked,

1
00:25:11,785 --> 00:25:14,538
- in a bedroom. Not me.
- Whatever, homey.

1
00:25:14,622 --> 00:25:16,540
I like pussy like you.

1
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,960
- I can dig it.
- Yeah, you can dig it.

1
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:22,254
Everybody will be pregnant
by the end of this flight.

1
00:25:23,172 --> 00:25:24,423
Hello.

1
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,218
First class.
Right this way, big daddy.

1
00:25:29,887 --> 00:25:31,722
Welcome to NWA.

1
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:35,643
Hi. How's everybody?

1
00:25:35,726 --> 00:25:38,312
Good. Wow, this is great!

1
00:25:38,395 --> 00:25:41,482
Oh, y'all are in low class.

1
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:44,401
- What?
- Low class, straight back.

1
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,572
This is nice, too.

1
00:25:48,656 --> 00:25:51,283
Dad, this actually
isn't that bad.

1
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:03,754
What kind of UPN operation
is this?

1
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,506
It's not so bad.

1
00:26:08,217 --> 00:26:10,052
All right, here we are.

1
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,517
Row 17 Chrysler.
Honey, you sit here.

1
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,810
Thank you.

1
00:26:17,893 --> 00:26:20,354
- Do I have to sit...
- How you doin'?

1
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:25,734
You're gonna have to, okay?
Thank you.

1
00:26:25,776 --> 00:26:29,196
Let's please
put the divider down.

1
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:33,909
Do you have an "off" switch?
You need to lower the volume.

1
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:36,787
Man, you give a black man
some money,

1
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,124
this is how the airline's
gonna look... plush, laid.

1
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,418
It's makin' me feel sexy
already.

1
00:26:42,459 --> 00:26:43,794
This is a sexy plane.

1
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,213
They got it chromed out
with the white leather.

1
00:26:46,297 --> 00:26:48,632
I think this is alligator butt.

1
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:52,011
Yeah, this is nice.

1
00:26:52,094 --> 00:26:54,263
Little treat for you
before the plane takes off, daddy,

1
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:56,390
'cause you treat me so right.

1
00:26:56,473 --> 00:26:58,475
You nasty!

1
00:27:04,481 --> 00:27:05,691
Can I help you, sir?

1
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:08,152
Everything's okay,
I'm just trying to find my seat,

1
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:15,659
Boy, this a nice plane.

1
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:19,038
Nice cushion they got
on these new planes.

1
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:22,082
This must be
one of them 777's.

1
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:24,877
7574327.

1
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,087
Where my seat? 777.

1
00:27:27,171 --> 00:27:28,797
The president
should fly on this plane.

1
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:33,177
- Hello, sir.
- Hey, baby, how you doin'?

1
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,096
- I'm gonna show you to your seat.
- That's nice of you, cutie pie.

1
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:39,892
- Here we are.
- Let me shake your hand.

1
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:43,687
Come here. Oh, boy!
That's nice. Look at that.

1
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:47,107
Boy, I can just hear everything.

1
00:27:47,191 --> 00:27:50,903
It's so beautiful in here.
Wait a minute.

1
00:27:51,028 --> 00:27:53,530
Somebody got
some nice perfume on.

1
00:27:53,656 --> 00:27:55,991
Is that
Victoria Don't Tell Nobody?

1
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:59,828
- No.
- Is that Boujeronee?

1
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:02,539
Not Boujeronee either.

1
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,376
I like the people
that don't talk back.

1
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,211
Hard to get, I like that.

1
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:10,547
Cabin attendant?

1
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:11,840
Yes, sir?

1
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:14,927
Howdy do.
Where are you, baby?

1
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,345
There you are.

1
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:21,475
Get me a quadruple cognac
and a cola back.

1
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:25,354
You know, I'm scared to fly.
I'm used to ridin' buses.

1
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,232
My little nephew
sent me on first class,

1
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:30,025
because I'm a player.

1
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:32,695
You smell good, too.

1
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:37,616
I'm gonna have me some fun
on this plane here.

1
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,453
Okey-dokey. So you're
gonna be in...

1
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:48,168
You're gonna go ahead
to low class, okay.

1
00:28:51,255 --> 00:28:53,382
- He tasted like chocolate.
- No way.

1
00:29:01,515 --> 00:29:03,434
My God, what's going on?

1
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:09,982
Get the fuck out!

1
00:29:10,065 --> 00:29:12,067
What is he doing?
Watch him.

1
00:29:15,905 --> 00:29:17,781
Y'all better get his ass!

1
00:29:29,627 --> 00:29:31,837
You ain't goin' nowhere
without us, Osama.

1
00:29:31,962 --> 00:29:34,840
If you gots to go
to the bathroom, we goin' with you.

1
00:29:34,924 --> 00:29:37,301
She holdin'
and I'm shakin', player.

1
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:39,970
- That's right.
- It's cool, y'all. We got this.

1
00:29:40,054 --> 00:29:41,847
We security up in here.
Look straight.

1
00:29:46,477 --> 00:29:47,686
- Hi.
- Hey.

1
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,855
This first class is incredible.

1
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:52,399
Girl, this plane is off the hook.
Have you seen the owner?

1
00:29:52,483 --> 00:29:55,903
He's young, black, and from
the pictures I've seen,

1
00:29:55,986 --> 00:29:57,071
he looks so good.

1
00:29:57,154 --> 00:29:58,572
I'm sure he's great.

1
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,325
- <i>And he's paid.
- Please direct your attention</i>

1
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:03,994
<i>to the screen in front of you
for a safety video.</i>

1
00:30:22,012 --> 00:30:23,430
What is this?

1
00:30:23,514 --> 00:30:25,391
<i>Now that you got on our plane
and you be listenin'.</i>

1
00:30:25,474 --> 00:30:28,686
<i>You better just do as we say
or you'll be missin'.</i>

1
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:32,273
<i>Better put your seatbelt on
or you'll be dyin'.</i>

1
00:30:32,356 --> 00:30:34,525
<i>If the plane goes crazy,
then you will not be flyin'.</i>

1
00:30:34,608 --> 00:30:37,403
<i>Now we direct you to
the nearest locations.</i>

1
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:40,489
<i>Where you might desire
to exit your vacations.</i>

1
00:30:40,531 --> 00:30:43,659
<i>If we lose the pressure,
you'll be chokin'.</i>

1
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:47,204
<i>Or if there's a fire,
then you'll be smokin'.</i>

1
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:49,164
<i>The oxygen we will be providin'.</i>

1
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:51,667
This some black shit here.

1
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:54,169
<i>You're a survivor.</i>

1
00:30:54,211 --> 00:30:56,213
- Here we go.
- There we go.

1
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:58,465
<i>You're a survivor,
you'll keep on flyin'.</i>

1
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:02,595
<i>You're a survivor,
you don't go down there.</i>

1
00:31:02,678 --> 00:31:05,055
Honey, what is this?

1
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:07,308
<i>You're a survivor,
you not be dyin'.</i>

1
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:10,227
<i>You're a survivor,

1
00:31:10,311 --> 00:31:13,606
<i>You're a survivor,
you don't go down there.</i>

1
00:31:13,731 --> 00:31:15,900
<i>You're a survivor,
you got your fair share.</i>

1
00:31:16,025 --> 00:31:18,068
<i>You're a survivor.</i>

1
00:31:18,193 --> 00:31:22,615
<i>Whoo, you're a survivor.</i>

1
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:29,204
There's the owner right there.

1
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:35,044
<i>Hello, everybody.
Welcome to NWA Airlines.</i>

1
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,796
<i>Here at NWA, safety is
a very important part of flying,</i>

1
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,089
<i>but let's be real.</i>

1
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:41,842
<i>If something goes wrong,
we're all going down, right?</i>

1
00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:44,011
Is that supposed to be funny?

1
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,014
<i>I'm just kiddin'... I'm playin'.</i>

1
00:31:47,097 --> 00:31:49,099
<i>That's why it's our policy
that fun comes first.</i>

1
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:51,268
<i>So please, sit back, relax,
and enjoy your flight.</i>

1
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:52,603
<i>You're a survivor.</i>

1
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:55,105
<i>You are.</i>

1
00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:07,076
Come on, now, stop it.

1
00:32:07,117 --> 00:32:08,827
You got a brother
feelin' like the president.

1
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:10,788
God bless America.

1
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:16,293
Giselle?

1
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:19,004
I gotta get outta here.

1
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:21,090
Giselle, wait.

1
00:32:21,215 --> 00:32:23,175
Giselle, can you
wait a minute, please?

1
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,260
What, Nashawn?

1
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:26,804
What do we possibly
have to talk about?

1
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,182
Wow, I mean, you look great.

1
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:34,103
How you been?

1
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:37,064
I've been fine. Just fine.

1
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:40,192
Is that all?

1
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:43,612
Actually, no, I mean.
I was doin' some thinkin'.

1
00:32:43,654 --> 00:32:45,114
And I wanna talk to you.

1
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:48,409
Can I at least talk to you?

1
00:32:48,492 --> 00:32:51,287
Giselle, where you gonna go?
The door is closed.

1
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,457
What's this?

1
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:57,334
Someone stepped up,
Nashawn.

1
00:32:57,418 --> 00:32:59,295
I'm engaged.

1
00:33:12,683 --> 00:33:16,061
Hey, baby. It's not
a good time right now.

1
00:33:19,356 --> 00:33:22,109
There's no easy way
for me...

1
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:24,528
for me to say this...

1
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:28,032
What?

1
00:33:28,157 --> 00:33:30,034
This isn't workin' for me
anymore.

1
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:31,201
What's not workin'?

1
00:33:35,873 --> 00:33:38,500
- This is gettin' way too serious.
- What are you talkin' about?

1
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:43,213
I can't do this anymore.

1
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:45,257
- I can't.
- No.

1
00:33:46,717 --> 00:33:48,594
You got change of a 50, man?

1
00:33:52,223 --> 00:33:55,726
- Not right now, Muggs.
- Not now?

1
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,229
What's his problem, man?

1
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:07,238
Oh, boy.

1
00:34:10,532 --> 00:34:13,285
Hey, hey, there, Blanca.

1
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:17,915
I was wondering if I could
trouble you for a drink.

1
00:34:17,998 --> 00:34:20,251
Ain't no drink down there.

1
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:21,835
Hell there ain't.

1
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,213
I don't know if I ever
told you this,

1
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:27,091
but I speak a little Español.

1
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:28,592
Really?

1
00:34:48,737 --> 00:34:50,322
Testicles, one, two.

1
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:54,159
Hey, y'all, what's crackalackin'?

1
00:34:54,243 --> 00:34:58,247
This is your soul plane chauffeur,
Captain Antoine Mack speaking.

1
00:34:58,289 --> 00:34:59,915
He sounds nice.

1
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:02,459
<i>Welcome aboard NWA</i>

So screw your shit on tight

1
00:35:19,602 --> 00:35:20,811
What did he say?

1
00:35:20,895 --> 00:35:23,939
He was just saying that we'll be
leaving in a couple of seconds,

1
00:35:24,023 --> 00:35:26,317
so put your seatbelt on,
make sure they're tight.

1

Amateurs.

1
00:35:31,322 --> 00:35:33,699
- Why didn't he say so?
- Exactly.

Bounce, bounce.

No, man, you gotta
turn that bullshit off.

Get that shit out.
Get it the fuck outta here.

1
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,134
I'm the captain
of this motherfuckin' ship.

1
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:20,282
Captain, what the hell
is wrong with you?

1
00:38:23,452 --> 00:38:25,621
Man, I'm afraid of heights.

1
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:27,289
Afraid of heights?!

1
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:34,630
Hit her with a bat,
hit her with a bat.

1
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,507
Hit her with a whoo-whoo.

1
00:38:39,843 --> 00:38:43,472
- Easy, Kobe. She's 17.
- Dad, I'm 18.

1
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:53,274
Honey, I'm gonna
excuse myself

1
00:38:53,357 --> 00:38:56,193
- and go to the restroom.
- Okay.

1
00:39:00,197 --> 00:39:02,658
I think I'm gonna go
check out the plane.

00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,034
Is that all right?

1
00:39:04,118 --> 00:39:07,705
- Why are you so nice to me?
- Stay for a while.

1
00:39:12,835 --> 00:39:16,130
Oh, my sweet black Jesus!

1
00:39:18,507 --> 00:39:19,758
Hey, good evenin'.

1
00:39:19,842 --> 00:39:21,176
I didn't know
anybody was in here.

1
00:39:21,218 --> 00:39:23,721
- I'll come back later.
- Why? I'm still gonna be here.

1
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:25,180
I tell you what.

1
00:39:25,222 --> 00:39:27,725
You take care of your business,
I take care of mine.

1
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:30,561
I just don't feel comfortable,
I'll just hold it.

1
00:39:30,603 --> 00:39:32,605
You don't want to do that.

1
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:36,358
That stuff back up on you,
top of your head fly clean off.

1
00:39:36,483 --> 00:39:37,860
Sit down,
make yourself at home.

1
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:39,111
I'm sorry.

1
00:39:39,194 --> 00:39:41,822
We don't get that many of y'all
on the plane.

1
00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:44,366
For those with no junk
in their trunk.

1
00:39:45,242 --> 00:39:46,577
That is a nice vest.

1
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,871
I ain't seen one of them
since Lionel and the Jeffersons.

1
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:51,707
What ever happened to Lionel?
I thought he was...

1
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:52,750
Would you mind?

1
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,294
Oh, I'm sorry.
Little fella kinda shy?

1
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:02,009
Goddamn!

1
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:03,344
Sorry.

1
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:05,512
I guess you can't have lightnin'
without the thunder.

1
00:40:05,596 --> 00:40:07,598
Somebody still likes
that pork, I see.

1
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:11,268
I think this was a false alarm.
I'm gonna go back to my seat.

1
00:40:11,393 --> 00:40:12,561
The paint is peeling.

1
00:40:14,271 --> 00:40:15,981
That must be a big one.

1
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:17,691
Yeah, it's big.

1
00:40:17,775 --> 00:40:18,984
I've got just the thing.

1
00:40:40,172 --> 00:40:43,634
I can't believe that
this is you.

1
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:45,678
So you subscribe to
"Black & Proud"?

1
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:48,847
This is the first time
I've picked it up.

1
00:40:48,931 --> 00:40:51,016
Yeah, it was freezin'
that day.

1
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,895
Really? You could never tell that
from the picture.

1
00:40:54,979 --> 00:40:56,855
Why, thank you.

1
00:40:56,939 --> 00:41:00,317
Usually, the problem is, I'm hangin'
out the bottom of my boxers.

1
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:02,444
Oh, my goodness.

1
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,238
Hi.

1
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,323
I think you're in my seat.

1
00:41:06,407 --> 00:41:08,826
Oh, hi, honey.
This is Jerome.

1
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:09,952
Hi.

1
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:11,036
Hello.

1
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,832
Jerome was telling me about how he
hangs out the bottom of his boxers.

1
00:41:14,957 --> 00:41:16,709
That's nice.

1
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:18,460
They're about to serve dinner,

1
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:20,421
so you might want
to go back to your chair.

1
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:25,801
Oh, yeah. You're right.

1
00:41:25,843 --> 00:41:26,969
Yeah.

1
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:28,596
It was nice meetin' you.

1
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:30,180
It was nice meeting you, too, Barbara.

1
00:41:30,264 --> 00:41:32,391
Nice meeting you, too, Jerome.

1
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:35,895
Bye.

1
00:41:41,942 --> 00:41:44,153
Hangin' out
the bottom of his boxers...

1
00:41:44,194 --> 00:41:45,738
My God, is that him?!

1
00:41:47,364 --> 00:41:51,285
- That thing has a face on it,
- No, but it's gonna.

1
00:41:53,704 --> 00:41:54,747
Are you all right, sir?

1
00:41:54,872 --> 00:41:57,333
Course, I'm all right,
I'm a G, ain't I?

1
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:58,918
I will make the announcement.

1
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:01,503
No, you won't.
Give me this motherfucker.

1
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:03,672
I'm makin' the announcement.
I'm the captain.

1
00:42:04,048 --> 00:42:07,927
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
reached our cruising altitude

1
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,929
of 33,000 feet,

1
00:42:10,012 --> 00:42:12,097
33,000 feet?!

1
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:15,351
Oh, shit, man. We fuckin' higher
than Redman at the Source awards.

1
00:42:15,434 --> 00:42:17,394
<i>Shit don't make
no motherfuckin' sense</i>

1
00:42:17,436 --> 00:42:18,938
<i>to be this high, cuz.</i>

1
00:42:19,063 --> 00:42:21,774
Man, I feel sick. Oh, fuck.

1
00:42:23,984 --> 00:42:25,361
Ain't this some shit?

1
00:42:28,697 --> 00:42:30,157
What the hell's goin' on here?

1
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:32,243
This nigga's afraid of heights.

1
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:34,662
How you gonna be afraid
of heights if you the captain?

1
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:36,330
I ain't never
been off the ground before.

1
00:42:36,413 --> 00:42:37,915
We've flown computer
simulators.

1
00:42:37,998 --> 00:42:41,961
You told me you got your wings
when you got out the Air Force.

1
00:42:42,044 --> 00:42:43,587
No, I didn't.

1
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:45,881
I told you I got my wings
when I got out.

1
00:42:45,923 --> 00:42:48,634
When I got out of Pelican Bay
State Corrections Facility.

1
00:42:48,717 --> 00:42:51,762
It was either get a GED
or take a pilot class.

1
00:42:51,845 --> 00:42:53,847
You learned how to fly
in the prison?

1
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:55,933
Hey, man, don't get mad
'cause I spent your money

1
00:42:55,975 --> 00:42:56,934
to get a good education.

1
00:42:57,059 --> 00:43:00,980
Shit, me and my homeboys
passed the class with flying colors.

1
00:43:01,063 --> 00:43:03,065
Let me see.

1
00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:05,401
- I miss them niggas, man.
- Those are his niggas.

1
00:43:05,442 --> 00:43:07,069
The Taliban.

1
00:43:08,112 --> 00:43:09,863
I'm gonna tell you what.

1
00:43:09,947 --> 00:43:12,950
Y'all better fix it.
Gay-man, Captain Mack...

1
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:14,034
It's Gaeman!

1
00:43:14,118 --> 00:43:15,953
I don't give a damn.
Fix it.

1
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:17,955
I'm no bitch, you understand?
It's Gaeman.

1
00:43:18,038 --> 00:43:20,457
You gonna be a gay man.
Fix it.

1
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:22,418
Put this shit on autopilot.

1
00:43:22,459 --> 00:43:25,087
I'm goin' to the lavatory.
I got to boo-boo.

1
00:43:28,215 --> 00:43:31,010
- What ya doin'?
- I'm countin' my tips.

1
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:34,054
- Tips from where?
- Back there,

1
00:43:38,058 --> 00:43:39,977
low class motherfucker.

1
00:43:44,523 --> 00:43:47,192
Hey, nigga! Oh, boss man.

1
00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:52,072
Hey, man, you mind
if I get in here?

1
00:43:52,156 --> 00:43:53,157
Come on.

1
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,118
Hold on. Got a new shooter.

1
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,412
- One shot, baby, you in?
- No.

1
00:43:58,495 --> 00:43:59,830
Nigga, is ya in? What?

1
00:43:59,914 --> 00:44:01,832
- You said I could run business class, right?
- Yeah, I did.

1
00:44:01,957 --> 00:44:04,084
So I'm runnin' this motherfucker
like Vegas on fight night.

1
00:44:04,168 --> 00:44:06,003
We got a cockfight
we settin' up in ten minutes.

1
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:08,005
Cockfight?! I'm in.

1
00:44:10,174 --> 00:44:12,051
No. Let me tell you over here.

1
00:44:12,134 --> 00:44:14,011
I don't even want
everybody in my business.

1
00:44:14,053 --> 00:44:15,304
Hold me down.

1
00:44:18,098 --> 00:44:20,392
- What's up, cuz?
- You know what?

1
00:44:20,476 --> 00:44:21,852
I'm not even gonna make
a scene in here.

1
00:44:21,936 --> 00:44:23,938
I'm goin' back
to the front of the plane.

1
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:27,149
When I get back here,
I want this to be business class.

1
00:44:27,191 --> 00:44:30,236
- Okay. You got it, man.
- You can do that for me?

1
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,029
My man. Thank you, Muggs.

1
00:44:37,117 --> 00:44:38,744
Would you like
champagne or wine?

1
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:39,870
We'll have champagne.

1
00:44:39,995 --> 00:44:41,580
Would you like Moet or Cristal?

1
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:46,502
Motit... et. Moet.

1
00:44:46,585 --> 00:44:48,254
All right.

1
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:50,965
I know you have a drinking problem,
so please drink slow.

1
00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:55,844
That's for you. And sir,
please don't swallow your ice.

1
00:44:55,886 --> 00:44:57,471
That's all I can afford
to give you.

1
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:02,685
Hello. Would you like Colt. 45
or Alizé?

1
00:45:05,145 --> 00:45:06,981
Maybe you could explain to us
what those are.

1
00:45:07,064 --> 00:45:08,399
My pleasure, sir.

1
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:10,943
Colt. 45 tastes like
liquored-up beer,

1
00:45:11,026 --> 00:45:13,070
and it sneaks up on you
all of a sudden.

1
00:45:14,405 --> 00:45:17,116
And Alizé... oh, that's my favorite.
It's from France.

1
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:18,909
It's a cog-nac, it's very fruity,

1
00:45:18,993 --> 00:45:20,869
and it'll make you wanna do
the hucklebuck,

1
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:23,205
then pass out
in your own juices.

1
00:45:23,247 --> 00:45:24,582
Guess I'll have that.

1
00:45:24,623 --> 00:45:25,958
Wise choice.

1
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:28,377
Yo, player, you got a little
somethin'- somethin' for me?

1
00:45:28,419 --> 00:45:30,588
Yeah, I have a shorty 40.

1
00:45:30,671 --> 00:45:34,049
No, no. Do you have
any whole milk?

1
00:45:34,091 --> 00:45:35,092
Sir, that is nasty.

1
00:45:35,175 --> 00:45:39,221
I do have a Puerto Rican lady who's
lactatin', I'll see what I can do.

1
00:45:40,931 --> 00:45:43,434
Tonight, we're serving a plate
of gourmet soul food

1
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:45,936
with your choice of lobster
and filet mignon

1
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,647
or crisp duck confit,

1
00:45:48,731 --> 00:45:50,107
I'll have the filet,

1
00:45:55,279 --> 00:45:56,739
And for you, sir?

1
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,117
I ordered a special
Kosher meal... yag-weh.

1
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:01,410
Excuse me?

1
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:03,412
That's fried chicken
in hot sauce.

1
00:46:03,454 --> 00:46:06,707
Lobster, filet mignon or duck?

1
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,251
I'll take the fee-LAN.

1
00:46:10,961 --> 00:46:13,797
All right, I need you to take
a breast or a leg and a wing

1
00:46:13,881 --> 00:46:16,050
and pass it back. Exactly.

1
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:18,427
You guys, share your napkins
with your neighbor.

1
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:21,388
One for every two people.
Sharing is caring.

1
00:46:21,472 --> 00:46:22,806
Don't get greedy. One piece.

1
00:46:22,848 --> 00:46:25,434
Hi. Would you like
some dessert?

1
00:46:28,062 --> 00:46:30,022
Boss man, low class
is outta liquor,

1
00:46:30,105 --> 00:46:32,691
so I thought I would
come in here and...

1
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:39,740
Someone is strollin' down
memory Lane.

1
00:46:42,117 --> 00:46:45,120
No, I'm just, you know,
checkin' on things,

1
00:46:45,204 --> 00:46:46,705
makin' sure they okay,
that's all.

1
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:48,916
Yeah, right. I know that look.

1
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:52,002
I had that same look of regret
after I ran into Lee...

1
00:46:52,127 --> 00:46:54,630
My little Asian butterfly.

1
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:58,092
We had a whirlwind romance
that ended in heartbreak...

1
00:46:58,175 --> 00:47:00,344
and stomach pumpin'.

1
00:47:00,427 --> 00:47:04,807
When I saw him again,
I tried to apologize, but I couldn't.

1
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,476
I just felt so bad leaving him
in that hospital

1
00:47:07,518 --> 00:47:09,228
all bloated and distended.

1
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,479
Did you just grind on me?

1
00:47:10,521 --> 00:47:11,981
A little.

1
00:47:12,022 --> 00:47:14,358
What does that sick-ass story
have to do with me?

1
00:47:14,441 --> 00:47:16,360
I've never left nobody
in the hospital filled with nothin'.

1
00:47:16,443 --> 00:47:18,654
It means, Mr. Righteous,
that if you have a chance

1
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:20,322
to make things right again,
you should take it.

1
00:47:20,406 --> 00:47:22,157
Who knows
what could've happened?

1
00:47:22,283 --> 00:47:26,662
Lee had plenty ancient secret
to show me.

1
00:47:26,704 --> 00:47:29,790
Thank you. Flame.
Okay?

1
00:47:29,873 --> 00:47:31,834
You're welcome.

1
00:47:36,422 --> 00:47:39,884
Now, how much Colt. 45
to Sierra Mist do you mix

1
00:47:39,925 --> 00:47:42,469
to get bubbly?
Probably half and half.

1
00:47:43,846 --> 00:47:44,972
You mind if I sit down?

1
00:47:45,055 --> 00:47:46,515
It's your plane.

1
00:47:48,893 --> 00:47:50,728
It really doesn't have
to be like this.

1
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:52,062
How is it supposed to be?

1
00:47:53,898 --> 00:47:56,150
So who's this guy?

1
00:47:58,736 --> 00:48:00,654
Let's just let it go, okay?

1
00:48:02,197 --> 00:48:04,867
I just came over here
to talk to you.

1
00:48:06,327 --> 00:48:08,412
You just disappeared.
I didn't even hear from you.

1
00:48:08,495 --> 00:48:12,082
Giselle, you were 3,000 miles away.
I tried to get in touch with you.

1
00:48:14,084 --> 00:48:16,086
Let's just let it go.

1
00:48:36,106 --> 00:48:40,778
I don't know what smells better...
This meal or your delightful perfume.

1
00:48:40,861 --> 00:48:43,364
Thank you. You're too kind.

1
00:48:43,447 --> 00:48:48,327
You know, a lot of smart women
find blind men sexy.

1
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:49,578
- You know why?
- No.

1
00:48:49,662 --> 00:48:51,413
But I'm sure
you're about to tell me.

1
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:55,834
When you lose one sense,
it makes your other senses stronger,

1
00:48:55,918 --> 00:48:58,295
I have more of a sensitive touch
than the average man,

1
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,421
Please!

1
00:49:01,215 --> 00:49:02,675
Let me tell you about
this love I had,

1
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,386
She was on the trampoline,
landed right in my lap.

1
00:49:05,469 --> 00:49:07,388
Bang! She stayed there
for 15 years.

1
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:10,432
People crazy about me.
People love me.

1
00:49:10,516 --> 00:49:12,142
- You don't say.
- Don't say?

1
00:49:12,226 --> 00:49:14,103
I do say it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1
00:49:14,144 --> 00:49:16,230
People love me.
See these fingers here?

1
00:49:16,313 --> 00:49:20,442
These fingers got eyes on 'em
just like 20/20 vision.

1
00:49:20,484 --> 00:49:22,444
You know what I mean?

1
00:49:22,486 --> 00:49:26,240
They... wait a minute.

1
00:49:26,323 --> 00:49:27,950
Move that other leg
out the way.

1
00:49:28,033 --> 00:49:29,493
Move that dress up, girl.

1
00:49:29,535 --> 00:49:32,580
Oh, boy, moist.
You just as tender as you can be.

1
00:49:32,663 --> 00:49:36,041
You a little frisky thing.
You got a little puddle here.

1
00:49:37,251 --> 00:49:39,253
Oh, you big, too.
You ain't no baby.

1
00:49:39,336 --> 00:49:42,673
This is wonderful.
I love freaky stuff like this.

1
00:49:42,756 --> 00:49:45,009
Just let yourself go.
I'm gonna let myself go, too.

1
00:49:45,092 --> 00:49:46,135
I'm feelin' something, too.

1
00:49:46,176 --> 00:49:49,805
This ain't like me.
I don't usually go this quick.

1
00:49:49,847 --> 00:49:50,890
I'm goin' now.

1
00:50:05,446 --> 00:50:07,740
Let me tell you.
Where my yack?

1
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:21,378
I'm a player... player!

1
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,505
- Hey, now.
- Oh, excuse me,

1
00:50:23,547 --> 00:50:25,549
No, it's cool,
I'm the attendant,

1
00:50:25,591 --> 00:50:27,218
You can sit this one out,
my brother.

1
00:50:27,301 --> 00:50:28,969
I'm just gonna wash my hands.

1
00:50:29,053 --> 00:50:30,638
Got me a wild woman
sittin' next to me

1
00:50:30,721 --> 00:50:34,391
and look what I got.
Bang! Stinky pinky.

1
00:50:35,226 --> 00:50:36,769
Stinky pinky, here you go.

1
00:50:36,852 --> 00:50:39,521
Hey, brother. I ain't washin'
that one, I'm washin' this one.

1
00:50:41,357 --> 00:50:45,319
She usin' cilantro.
I love that freaky shit.

1
00:50:47,071 --> 00:50:48,906
The only way you got
stinky pinky

1
00:50:48,989 --> 00:50:50,866
is if you was sittin' next to
Miss Potato Head.

1
00:50:50,908 --> 00:50:53,118
There's always some dude
who's a player hater

1
00:50:53,202 --> 00:50:54,286
'cause he ain't gettin' none.

1
00:50:57,581 --> 00:51:00,292
Just 'cause you blind don't mean
I won't whip your ass.

1
00:51:00,376 --> 00:51:02,753
Lookin' like a disco lemon.
Son of a bitch!

1
00:51:02,878 --> 00:51:06,465
All right, you suit-and-tie-wearin'
motherfuckers.

1
00:51:06,507 --> 00:51:09,051
A little green
gets you in between.

1
00:51:09,134 --> 00:51:12,346
The more dough,
the more they show.

1
00:51:12,429 --> 00:51:15,391
Now, a true player
is a payer, am I right?

1
00:51:15,432 --> 00:51:16,433
That's what's up.

1
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,436
We don't park collars
at NWA... we park dollars.

1
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,729
You heard me?

1
00:51:20,771 --> 00:51:24,942
If you can afford business class,
you can afford some business ass.

1
00:51:25,025 --> 00:51:27,570
Hey, Muggs, what's goin' on?

1
00:51:27,653 --> 00:51:29,738
- Where?
- Here.

1
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,409
- Here. What is this?
- It's all good up in here, baby.

1
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:36,161
We got Asian persuasion,
butter pecan freakin',

1
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:37,288
chocolate deluxe.

1
00:51:37,371 --> 00:51:39,540
I got it all
in my little shopping mall.

1
00:51:39,623 --> 00:51:41,417
What is it you're not gettin'?

1
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:45,588
First gamblin', now this?
It's illegal, man.

1
00:51:45,671 --> 00:51:47,172
You with the FAA, nigga?

1
00:51:47,298 --> 00:51:49,216
- No. What are you talkin' about?
- Ain't no rules in the air.

1
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,218
Listen to me.
That's not the point, man.

1
00:51:51,302 --> 00:51:54,430
It's a family airline.
You got ladies up in here?

1
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:55,472
I sure do!

1
00:51:57,308 --> 00:52:00,185
Listen to me.
We not in the 'hood no more.

1
00:52:00,269 --> 00:52:01,353
Hey, Nashawn.

1
00:52:01,478 --> 00:52:04,189
Hey! What's this about?

1
00:52:04,231 --> 00:52:05,858
The girls just wanted
to show their appreciation

1
00:52:05,941 --> 00:52:07,902
for everything you've done.

1
00:52:07,985 --> 00:52:09,320
If you stick around for a minute.

1
00:52:09,403 --> 00:52:12,156
I'm sure it'd make the ladies
very, very happy.

1
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:13,324
Start with this.

1
00:52:14,575 --> 00:52:16,327
Just like that?

1
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:17,411
You're so sexy.

1
00:52:17,494 --> 00:52:19,496
Whoa! Slow down!

1
00:52:20,664 --> 00:52:21,749
Back up.

1
00:52:21,832 --> 00:52:25,294
Oh, my God!
Hey, move, devil.

1
00:52:25,377 --> 00:52:26,587
Get it together
and get it fast.

1
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:28,088
You got to get off the pole.

1
00:52:28,172 --> 00:52:30,883
Hey, baby, watch your step.
Hey.

1
00:52:32,343 --> 00:52:33,928
I guess there are some things
you can commit to.

1
00:52:34,011 --> 00:52:36,222
You talkin' 'bout this?

1
00:52:37,473 --> 00:52:39,099
I'm just doin' my job,
that's all.

1
00:52:39,183 --> 00:52:40,643
Yeah, it looks like
you're a workaholic.

1
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:44,063
And here I was thinkin' I was
too hard on you before.

1
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,983
Guess you're the man now.

1
00:52:51,695 --> 00:52:53,280
Wait, Giselle.

1
00:52:57,034 --> 00:52:58,786
What the fuck am I doin'?!

1
00:53:04,124 --> 00:53:05,501
You ready for this?

1
00:53:05,542 --> 00:53:06,543
- Yeah.
- You ready?

1
00:53:06,627 --> 00:53:07,628
Oh, yeah, daddy.

1
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,088
- You sure?
- Wait.

1
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:10,756
Don't fight the feelin', baby.

1
00:53:14,176 --> 00:53:16,136
What the hell is you doin'
in here?

1
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,806
That's the problem with
you young cats. You talk too much.

1
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:20,307
- A woman like that...
- You do talk a lot.

1
00:53:20,391 --> 00:53:22,101
Wants a man of action.

1
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:26,355
I was wonderin' if you can
help my friend Ben here.

1
00:53:26,438 --> 00:53:28,399
He needs you to take him
back to his seat.

1
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,859
Yeah, Ben, I believe I know
where this cat is sittin'.

1
00:53:32,111 --> 00:53:34,822
Dig this here.
You don't need a lot of space.

1
00:53:34,905 --> 00:53:36,782
Superman changed
in a phone booth.

1
00:53:36,865 --> 00:53:40,452
Hey, don't be...
man, don't be touchin'...

1
00:53:40,536 --> 00:53:41,912
Tidy Bowl man.

1
00:53:41,954 --> 00:53:43,372
We gonna need this right here.

1
00:53:47,418 --> 00:53:49,879
- Ready for this?
- Oh, yeah.

1
00:53:49,962 --> 00:53:51,714
Hey, what the hell is this?

1
00:53:51,797 --> 00:53:53,257
I seen this on an episode
of "Real Sex".

1
00:53:53,299 --> 00:53:55,342
- You sure about this?
- Trust me.

1
00:53:55,426 --> 00:53:57,177
All you gotta do
is have a safety word.

1
00:53:57,261 --> 00:53:58,262
You got one?

1
00:53:58,345 --> 00:53:59,889
Yeah, when I say.
"Get off me, you crazy bitch",

1
00:53:59,972 --> 00:54:01,181
you stop chokin' me.

1
00:54:02,933 --> 00:54:03,976
Ow! Shit!

1
00:54:06,604 --> 00:54:08,063
Actually, I wish you'd stop
smackin' me.

1
00:54:08,105 --> 00:54:09,148
You like it.

1
00:54:09,273 --> 00:54:11,191
- It's tight.
- It's supposed to be tight.

1
00:54:11,275 --> 00:54:12,318
That's why you buy me
the good shit.

1
00:54:12,401 --> 00:54:14,612
The belt is too damn tight!

1
00:54:14,695 --> 00:54:18,699
Stop your bitch-ass complainin'
and give me what you promised.

1
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,661
I can't feel my toes!

1
00:54:22,745 --> 00:54:25,164
I can't feel your dick,
but I ain't complainin'.

1
00:54:25,247 --> 00:54:28,459
D.J., please, don't stop.
Five more seconds.

1
00:54:38,594 --> 00:54:42,223
Cheese, eggs, grits, chilies,
yams, sunflower seeds.

1
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:46,852
No. No!

1
00:54:46,936 --> 00:54:47,937
No?

1
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,606
Man, this is not the way
it happened on "Real Sex".

1
00:54:50,689 --> 00:54:52,650
This is some real bullshit.

1
00:54:52,733 --> 00:54:54,026
It was probably the turbulence

1
00:54:54,109 --> 00:54:57,780
and all the excituration
of the moment, 'cause I used...

1
00:54:57,821 --> 00:55:01,075
You see that, David.
Did you see that, David?

1
00:55:01,158 --> 00:55:02,826
Why you always got to go...

1
00:55:02,952 --> 00:55:05,120
I need to spank you
with the bad...

1
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:06,830
I'm gonna punish him.

1
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:10,793
This motherfuckin' autopilot shit
is cool as hell, man.

1
00:55:10,876 --> 00:55:13,337
Just kick back
and ride and glide.

1
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:16,966
Relax, motherfucker.
I should be captain of this plane.

1
00:55:17,091 --> 00:55:20,052
Ten years with Chuku Airlines.

1
00:55:20,135 --> 00:55:23,305
Chuku Airlines, where we treat you
with a lot of respect.

1
00:55:23,347 --> 00:55:25,224
This motherfucker.

1
00:55:25,307 --> 00:55:27,434
Now I'm here with this nigga.

1
00:55:28,686 --> 00:55:31,939
Nigga, shut the fuck up with that
African mumbo-jumbo bullshit.

1
00:55:32,022 --> 00:55:34,400
I hear you over there
with that Chuku Airlines shit.

1
00:55:34,483 --> 00:55:36,527
You with NWA Airlines,
I'm the captain.

1
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,654
- I don't care.
- Real niggas drive real shit.

1
00:55:38,737 --> 00:55:39,738
I should kill you.

1
00:55:41,365 --> 00:55:43,242
We have a birthday girl,
Captain.

1
00:55:43,325 --> 00:55:44,618
This is Heather Hunkee.

1
00:55:44,702 --> 00:55:47,079
She wanted to see
our cockpit.

1
00:55:47,204 --> 00:55:48,664
How old are you, Heather?

1
00:55:48,706 --> 00:55:49,707
I just turned 18.

1
00:55:49,832 --> 00:55:52,251
Is that right? Oh, boy.

1
00:55:52,334 --> 00:55:54,545
Attention, all players.

1
00:55:54,628 --> 00:55:57,631
The upper deck will be open
for your enjoyment.

1
00:55:57,715 --> 00:56:00,843
We have a passenger
who just turned 18 years old.

1
00:56:00,926 --> 00:56:02,344
Her name is Heather Hunkee.

1
00:56:02,428 --> 00:56:06,432
She is one cute little hottie
with a whole lotta body.

1
00:56:06,473 --> 00:56:08,183
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1
00:56:08,225 --> 00:56:11,562
She'll be upstairs, so all players
come up and keep her company.

1
00:56:11,604 --> 00:56:15,232
No!

1
00:56:22,823 --> 00:56:25,701
Hey, Virgie, how are you?
Good to see you.

1
00:56:25,743 --> 00:56:27,286
Yeah, I know. It's hot, right?

1
00:56:27,411 --> 00:56:29,288
This is hot.

1
00:56:29,371 --> 00:56:31,832
Let me take you to the bar.
Give me your jacket, girl.

1
00:56:35,586 --> 00:56:38,297
Big Boy!

1
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,090
All my pimps, players,
and hustlers...

1
00:56:40,174 --> 00:56:43,135
Y'all ready to set this motherfucker
off, West Coast style?

1
00:56:43,219 --> 00:56:45,387
As you see,
we up in the clouds.

1
00:56:45,429 --> 00:56:47,765
Got a gang of lovely ladies
out there on the dance floor

1
00:56:47,848 --> 00:56:50,559
ready to go ahead and shake
that ass and get they freak on.

1
00:56:50,601 --> 00:56:52,561
To my fellas out there
who ain't got no game...

1
00:56:52,645 --> 00:56:53,896
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you.

1
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:56,440
Don't even trip on it,
'cause we ain't goin' nowhere.

1
00:56:56,482 --> 00:56:59,401
We locked in this bitch for
four more hours till we touch down,

1
00:56:59,443 --> 00:57:01,612
so you might as well go ahead
and get your swerve on.

1
00:57:01,737 --> 00:57:05,407
- Marshall, good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

1
00:57:05,449 --> 00:57:07,785
This is Heather.
She's turnin' 18 today.

1
00:57:07,868 --> 00:57:09,036
Happy birthday.

1
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,455
- Thank you.
- Captain Mack is buyin' her

1
00:57:11,538 --> 00:57:12,706
her first drink.

1
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,208
What can I get for you?

1
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:15,960
Surprise me.

1
00:57:16,043 --> 00:57:17,461
I got just what you need.

1
00:57:18,712 --> 00:57:20,798
Girl, he is cute!

1
00:57:20,881 --> 00:57:22,091
I know. He's a looker.

1
00:57:23,926 --> 00:57:25,344
He'll hook you up.

1
00:57:33,227 --> 00:57:36,438
Cool! All right, have a good time.
I gotta go back downstairs.

1
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,731
Keep an eye on her.

1
00:57:37,815 --> 00:57:39,233
Oh, I will.

1
00:57:39,316 --> 00:57:40,943
Not that kind of eye.

1
00:57:40,985 --> 00:57:42,361
It's Big Boy.

1
00:57:42,444 --> 00:57:43,612
What's goin' down, y'all?

1
00:57:43,696 --> 00:57:45,573
We gonna keep
this motherfucker crackin'

1
00:57:45,656 --> 00:57:47,866
until everybody in here
pass the fuck out.

1
00:57:52,913 --> 00:57:55,124
Yeah, this is my joint
right here.

1
00:58:08,846 --> 00:58:12,016
- Who'd you come here with?
- Don't worry about that.

1
00:58:12,099 --> 00:58:14,518
- Please, Captain, I just...
- Hey, nigga!

1
00:58:14,602 --> 00:58:16,395
What part of "you ain't flyin'
this motherfuckin' plane"

1
00:58:16,478 --> 00:58:18,022
don't you understand?

1
00:58:18,105 --> 00:58:20,149
Sit back and enjoy the ride,
Idi Amin.

1
00:58:25,279 --> 00:58:27,531
What are you doing?
You fool!

1
00:58:27,615 --> 00:58:30,242
Any motherfuckin' dry ass
mushrooms of yours

1
00:58:30,326 --> 00:58:32,286
ain't gettin' me high
no motherfuckin' way.

1
00:58:32,369 --> 00:58:34,413
You need to fuck with the white boys.
They shit potent.

1
00:58:34,538 --> 00:58:35,789
White boys, American shit.

1
00:58:35,873 --> 00:58:37,833
This is African mushrooms,
very dangerous.

1
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:38,876
They can kill you!

1
00:58:39,001 --> 00:58:42,087
You ate 15 of them!
These are topical, for the skin.

1
00:58:42,171 --> 00:58:45,090
I crush them up,
and I put them...

1
00:58:47,509 --> 00:58:48,719
for my itching.

1
00:58:48,802 --> 00:58:50,679
Motherfucker, you got crabs?!

1
00:58:52,556 --> 00:58:55,726
This man got crabs. You ain't
sittin' in the pilot's seat for sure.

1
00:58:57,478 --> 00:58:59,396
Ha ha, keep laughing.
It's not funny.

1
00:59:00,314 --> 00:59:02,524
African crab is very aggressive.

1
00:59:03,692 --> 00:59:04,860
They hunt us.

1
00:59:05,945 --> 00:59:08,364
They can kill you.

1
00:59:08,405 --> 00:59:11,408
That motherfucker
is crazy as fuck, man.

1
00:59:11,533 --> 00:59:13,410
They dangerous,
and they kill you.

1
00:59:16,413 --> 00:59:18,165
Fuck!

1
00:59:18,249 --> 00:59:19,875
That Gaeman!

1
00:59:23,003 --> 00:59:24,046
Excuse me.

1
00:59:24,129 --> 00:59:26,882
Motherfucker,
did you just touch me?

1
00:59:26,966 --> 00:59:28,425
Yeah, I wanna get up
in the club.

1
00:59:28,509 --> 00:59:30,928
- You on the list?
- What list?

1
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,805
The goddamn guest list.

1
00:59:32,888 --> 00:59:34,473
- Are you on it?
- I don't know.

1
00:59:34,557 --> 00:59:36,559
You don't know?
What's your name?

1
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,018
Elvis Hunkee.

1
00:59:39,353 --> 00:59:41,605
I wouldn't even have wrote
no shit down like that, homey.

1
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:43,899
Maybe it's under The King,

1
00:59:43,983 --> 00:59:46,026
'cause my friends,
they call me "The King".

1
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:47,111
It's my nickname.

1
00:59:47,236 --> 00:59:49,613
I ain't your friend,
and you ain't no king, motherfucker.

1
00:59:49,655 --> 00:59:51,115
Right.

1
00:59:51,198 --> 00:59:54,368
Move! I'm talkin' to you.

1
00:59:54,451 --> 00:59:56,161
What's up? Go right in.

1
01:00:02,293 --> 01:00:04,920
All right, put 'em up.

1
01:00:04,962 --> 01:00:06,338
It's go time.

1
01:00:06,422 --> 01:00:08,883
It's definitely go time,
motherfucker.

1
01:00:08,966 --> 01:00:11,302
You about to get
the best damn ass-whippin'.

1
01:00:11,385 --> 01:00:14,096
I hope the little bitch
you're lookin' for is worth dyin' for.

1
01:00:14,221 --> 01:00:16,557
She is, 'cause that little bitch
is my daughter.

1
01:00:19,143 --> 01:00:20,144
Your daughter?

1
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,232
Why didn't you say
that shit, man?

1
01:00:25,316 --> 01:00:27,151
I got five daughters, man.

1
01:00:27,192 --> 01:00:30,779
The little one, Trina,
every time I see her.

1
01:00:30,821 --> 01:00:34,742
She just runs into my arms,
like, "Daddy. Daddy!"

1
01:00:34,825 --> 01:00:36,744
We have little tea parties
and shit.

1
01:00:36,827 --> 01:00:38,996
The little cups, and I put
the little hat on.

1
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:42,583
Little table, man.
It was so beautiful.

1
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:44,335
My heart would, like, explode.

1
01:00:44,418 --> 01:00:47,463
Yeah, I need to go upstairs.

1
01:00:47,588 --> 01:00:50,049
- I miss my babies.
- I miss mine, too. She's upstairs.

1
01:00:50,174 --> 01:00:52,593
I never see them.
I'm always busy securin' shit.

1
01:00:52,676 --> 01:00:54,929
- Honest living.
- I never see 'em, dawg.

1
01:00:55,012 --> 01:00:57,389
Secure your shit.

1
01:00:59,225 --> 01:01:01,685
Secure your shit.
Go get your girl, man.

1
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:03,187
Go get your little girl.

1
01:01:04,355 --> 01:01:05,856
Take care of your family, man!

1
01:01:08,859 --> 01:01:09,985
Who's on the list?

1
01:01:10,027 --> 01:01:12,780
Yo, Captain. I got to go
drain the monster.

1
01:01:12,863 --> 01:01:14,573
What the hell's taking
Gay-man so long?

1
01:01:14,657 --> 01:01:16,367
I don't know, I ain't his mama.

1
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:18,160
Matter of fact,
why don't you page him

1
01:01:18,202 --> 01:01:21,038
and tell him to bring
his bitch ass up here 911.

1
01:01:22,665 --> 01:01:23,791
Attention, Gay-man.

1
01:01:23,874 --> 01:01:26,710
<i>Attention, Gay-man,
I have to go drain the monster.</i>

1
01:01:26,794 --> 01:01:29,088
<i>Return to the cockpit
immediately.</i>

1
01:01:48,232 --> 01:01:51,068
Man, I wouldn't answer
that shit if I was you, homey.

1
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:54,238
Shake it up real fast
then stop.

1
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:58,951
Shake it up real fast
then drop.

1
01:02:01,287 --> 01:02:03,622
Shawty crunk on the floor
wide open.

1
01:02:03,747 --> 01:02:06,166
Skeet so much,
they call her Billy Ocean.

1
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:08,168
Roll like a 18-Wheeler.

1
01:02:08,252 --> 01:02:10,880
That... fine,
but this... killer.

1
01:02:10,921 --> 01:02:12,798
Leakin', she soakin' wet.

1
01:02:15,134 --> 01:02:18,304
- Muggsy, what are you doin'?
- Cut!

1
01:02:20,806 --> 01:02:21,932
Who the hell said cut?

1
01:02:22,016 --> 01:02:26,562
Yeah. Who the hell said cut?
The director says cut. Damn!

1
01:02:26,645 --> 01:02:28,272
Look, Nashawn.
I already know, dawg.

1
01:02:28,397 --> 01:02:31,066
Come here.
Is that the Ying Yang Twins?

1
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,902
Yeah.

1
01:02:32,985 --> 01:02:34,904
Watch out.
Ying Yang Twins!

1
01:02:34,945 --> 01:02:36,113
What's up, baby?

1
01:02:38,407 --> 01:02:39,992
Don't drink gasoline.
We got a bar.

1
01:02:40,075 --> 01:02:42,077
I had a gold tooth.
I shoulda kept it for this.

1
01:02:42,161 --> 01:02:43,162
Why y'all stop rollin'?

1
01:02:43,245 --> 01:02:44,246
'Cause you came in.

1
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:46,290
No, don't stop on account of me,
I'm the owner.

1
01:02:46,332 --> 01:02:48,792
Nashawn Wade... that's me.
I'm the boss of this.

1
01:02:48,876 --> 01:02:51,045
- Hey, roll camera!
- Who said roll camera?

1
01:02:51,128 --> 01:02:53,422
I say roll camera.

1
01:02:53,464 --> 01:02:55,341
- That's my job.
- That's his job.

1
01:02:55,424 --> 01:02:58,677
Chris, I'm tellin' ya, we need
more sexy in this video.

1
01:02:58,761 --> 01:03:00,137
Let's go, Tamika.
Get in there.

1
01:03:05,142 --> 01:03:06,227
This cool?

1
01:03:10,898 --> 01:03:13,817
- Yes, sir.
- Tamika, let's get in there.

1
01:03:13,859 --> 01:03:15,527
Get on in there, girl.

1
01:03:16,278 --> 01:03:17,571
Yo, Chris, I'm tellin' ya, man.

1
01:03:17,655 --> 01:03:19,823
We need more ass in this video,
and it'd be off the hook.

1
01:03:20,824 --> 01:03:22,993
Yo, Muggsy, who is this kid?

1
01:03:23,077 --> 01:03:24,495
Roll camera.

1
01:03:32,127 --> 01:03:34,630
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

1
01:03:40,678 --> 01:03:44,348
Lil' John back there.
Shake it like a salt shaker!

1
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:47,184
Can I get a glass of Hypno
with some ice, please?

1
01:03:47,268 --> 01:03:49,687
- Coming right up.
- What you doin' by yourself?

1
01:03:49,728 --> 01:03:52,189
- Go have a good time.
- No, thanks.

1
01:03:52,231 --> 01:03:55,943
- You okay?
- No.

1
01:03:56,026 --> 01:03:58,112
So what's goin' on?

1
01:03:58,195 --> 01:04:01,865
My son Billy... he doesn't
want to be anything like me.

1
01:04:01,991 --> 01:04:03,659
He says I got no flavor.

1
01:04:03,701 --> 01:04:06,453
My daughter Heather...
She's growin' up so fast.

1
01:04:06,537 --> 01:04:10,165
It seems like yesterday
I was teachin' her to ride a bike.

1
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:11,709
Now she's out there...

1
01:04:13,085 --> 01:04:14,169
Hey, what is tea-bagging?

1
01:04:16,881 --> 01:04:18,132
That's the shit!

1
01:04:18,215 --> 01:04:21,176
That's where you take your balls
and dip 'em in a freak mouth.

1
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:23,470
You keep goin'
up and down like...

1
01:04:25,347 --> 01:04:29,476
- Then you dip, right.
- I got it. Thank you.

1
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,729
I got a little carried away.

1
01:04:31,812 --> 01:04:35,190
Gettin' back on the subject...
You raise your kids right,

1
01:04:35,232 --> 01:04:37,067
eventually they gonna
wanna move on

1
01:04:37,151 --> 01:04:38,444
and find they own path.

1
01:04:38,569 --> 01:04:42,573
You're probably right.
You're a lucky man, Nashawn.

1
01:04:42,698 --> 01:04:44,199
I wouldn't say that.

1
01:04:44,283 --> 01:04:46,660
It took me gettin' everything
I ever wanted

1
01:04:46,744 --> 01:04:48,412
to realize I lost
the best thing I ever had.

1
01:04:48,495 --> 01:04:50,039
What was her name?

1
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:53,292
- Giselle.
- That's a beautiful name.

1
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:54,835
Bet she's beautiful.

1
01:04:54,919 --> 01:04:57,713
Very. Very!

1
01:04:57,755 --> 01:04:59,215
Still love her?

1
01:04:59,256 --> 01:05:00,758
Course I do.

1
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,426
Then go do somethin'
about it.

1
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:04,261
Listen, when I met
my Barbara.

1
01:05:04,303 --> 01:05:07,389
I knew that moment I'd move
heaven and earth to be with her.

1
01:05:07,431 --> 01:05:09,391
I knew that she was worth it.

1
01:05:09,433 --> 01:05:11,477
So you happy now?

1
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,187
Not really.

1
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:16,774
Last time I saw her,
she was with this tall model type.

1
01:05:17,816 --> 01:05:19,568
A real handsome black guy?

1
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:20,611
Yeah.

1
01:05:20,694 --> 01:05:21,862
Sittin' in low class?

1
01:05:21,946 --> 01:05:23,239
Yeah.

1
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,865
Got a dick like a fire hose?

1
01:05:24,949 --> 01:05:26,784
Yeah.

1
01:05:26,867 --> 01:05:29,328
Yeah, you lost her.

1
01:05:31,455 --> 01:05:33,832
- Can he get another one?
- Double.

1
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:35,793
Have you talked to her?

1
01:05:35,876 --> 01:05:37,962
She can't talk.
She must have vocal cord damage.

1
01:05:38,045 --> 01:05:39,046
I can believe it.

1
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:45,511
Man, if my baby mama page me
one more time, I swear to God...

1
01:05:45,636 --> 01:05:47,596
What she want?

1
01:05:47,638 --> 01:05:50,224
This motherfuckin' bitch wants
some more child support money

1
01:05:50,307 --> 01:05:51,475
'cause she heard I got this job.

1
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,352
<i>I can't believe these hos
nowadays.</i>

1
01:05:53,435 --> 01:05:55,854
<i>She extortin' you?
That's messed up, man.</i>

1
01:05:55,938 --> 01:05:57,606
<i>But you know what?</i>

1
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:59,900
<i>If I crash this motherfucker
into a mountain right now,</i>

1
01:05:59,984 --> 01:06:01,527
<i>the bitch can't get
shit from me.</i>

1
01:06:01,652 --> 01:06:02,611
Watch this.

1
01:06:08,033 --> 01:06:09,743
Oh, shit!

1
01:06:09,827 --> 01:06:15,207
Shit, my nigga!
Oh, shit! Hold on, cuz!

1
01:06:15,291 --> 01:06:17,585
- Oh, shit!
- Here we go.

1
01:06:22,756 --> 01:06:24,675
That shit was funny as hell.

1
01:06:24,758 --> 01:06:26,760
I know they trippin'
off this shit in the back.

1
01:06:30,472 --> 01:06:33,517
You fuckin' high, dawg.
You startin' to scare me now.

1
01:06:35,978 --> 01:06:37,146
Here ya go.

1
01:06:37,187 --> 01:06:39,940
I'm gonna bounce before
Gay-dude and Riggs come back.

1
01:06:40,024 --> 01:06:41,984
All right, my nigga.

1
01:06:45,029 --> 01:06:50,826
I'm put this bitch on autopilot
so I can enjoy myself.

1
01:06:56,624 --> 01:06:58,709
Captain Mack need to kick back

1
01:06:58,834 --> 01:07:01,879
and enjoy this
motherfuckin' situation.

1
01:07:02,004 --> 01:07:05,132
Oh, shit.
Last mushroom.

1
01:07:05,174 --> 01:07:07,259
Might as well go on
and take this to the head.

1
01:07:10,262 --> 01:07:14,058
Dry-ass mushroom,
African motherfucker.

1
01:07:35,162 --> 01:07:36,205
Here you are, sir.

1
01:07:40,834 --> 01:07:44,046
Oh, hey, that's my dad.
I need to talk to him.

1
01:07:46,382 --> 01:07:47,383
Hi, Daddy.

1
01:07:48,509 --> 01:07:49,677
Happy birthday, Heather.

1
01:07:51,262 --> 01:07:52,555
You mad at me?

1
01:07:52,596 --> 01:07:57,059
No, Actually, I'm just glad to hear
you call me daddy for a change,

1
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:58,227
It's been a while,

1
01:07:58,269 --> 01:08:00,396
Usually it's shithead or asshole
or something,

1
01:08:00,479 --> 01:08:03,357
I'm sorry. It's just
I hate that you're with Boobra.

1
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,902
Barbara... and I
are not together anymore.

1
01:08:06,986 --> 01:08:09,947
I'm still upset that
you and Mom aren't together.

1
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:12,074
I'm sorry about that, honey.

1
01:08:13,117 --> 01:08:15,619
But your mom's
with Dorothy now.

1
01:08:16,954 --> 01:08:18,497
I'd like to be with your mom.

1
01:08:18,581 --> 01:08:21,041
Hell, I'd love to be
with your mom and Dorothy.

1
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,918
But that's not important.

1
01:08:23,002 --> 01:08:25,212
What's important is that you know
that I'm your dad,

1
01:08:25,296 --> 01:08:28,132
and whether you're 18 or 48 or 88,
I'm gonna still protect you

1
01:08:28,173 --> 01:08:29,216
because I love you.

1
01:08:31,093 --> 01:08:32,344
I love you, too, Daddy.

1
01:08:33,804 --> 01:08:35,890
I'll always be your little girl.

1
01:08:35,973 --> 01:08:36,974
Right.

1
01:08:37,057 --> 01:08:38,350
I will.

1
01:08:38,434 --> 01:08:39,894
What about
all that stuff tonight?

1
01:08:39,977 --> 01:08:42,146
Oh, don't worry.
I didn't do anything.

1
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:43,689
Really?

1
01:08:43,814 --> 01:08:45,524
I was just saying stuff
to get you mad.

1
01:08:47,234 --> 01:08:49,737
I don't even know
what half that stuff is.

1
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:52,656
What's tea-bagging anyway?

1
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:54,366
That's when you
get down on top...

1
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:55,784
Dad!

1
01:08:55,826 --> 01:08:58,913
Apparently, it's the shit.
Come here.

1
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,628
So can I have
another blow job?

1
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:07,546
It's a drink.

1
01:09:10,007 --> 01:09:12,343
It's cool.

1
01:09:12,426 --> 01:09:15,554
Look, baby. I'm sorry,
and I wants to make it up to you.

1
01:09:17,848 --> 01:09:21,143
Don't get it started because you
know you're not gonna finish.

1
01:09:21,185 --> 01:09:24,855
Why you bringin' up old shit?
Let me see them tits!

1
01:09:28,108 --> 01:09:31,528
Okay, okay! What's the plan?

1
01:09:33,239 --> 01:09:35,991
Hold on one second.
I'm fixin' to be right back.

1
01:09:39,745 --> 01:09:43,707
Good evening, Cap.
Is it cool if I come in?

1
01:09:51,674 --> 01:09:53,842
This is tight up in here, dawg.

1
01:09:53,926 --> 01:09:55,928
I'm not gonna
beat around the bush, man.

1
01:09:56,011 --> 01:09:57,555
I'll get straight to the point.

1
01:09:57,638 --> 01:10:01,350
Me and my girl... we overly ambitious
members of the mile-high club.

1
01:10:01,433 --> 01:10:05,312
I was wondering if you would
let us come in here,

1
01:10:05,396 --> 01:10:08,607
and, we could, like, do it.

1
01:10:09,567 --> 01:10:10,609
All right, cool.

1
01:10:10,693 --> 01:10:11,694
I'm fixin' to get her.

1
01:10:11,777 --> 01:10:14,363
You probably gonna see
her titties and everything, man.

1
01:10:14,488 --> 01:10:15,948
I'll be right back, dawg.

1
01:10:26,876 --> 01:10:29,211
Hey, this is my girl.

1
01:10:30,296 --> 01:10:31,380
Hi, Captain.

1
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:34,717
I know you got stuff to do,

1
01:10:34,758 --> 01:10:36,802
so we just gonna
do our thing, man.

1
01:10:38,721 --> 01:10:40,890
Yeah, it's cool.

1
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,018
Okay, okay.

1
01:10:44,101 --> 01:10:48,564
No, no.
Ain't that my game.

1
01:10:55,154 --> 01:10:58,782
Ooh, yeah.
I like the way you doin' that.

1
01:10:58,866 --> 01:10:59,992
Ooh, work it, daddy.

1
01:11:00,075 --> 01:11:03,704
I'm tryin', but it's like
a sauna down here,

1
01:11:03,787 --> 01:11:04,788
It's like a fire...

1
01:11:05,831 --> 01:11:08,292
- How's that?
- Oh, it's good, daddy.

1
01:11:08,334 --> 01:11:10,085
You the king.

1
01:11:11,378 --> 01:11:13,380
Tastes like chocolate puddin'.

1
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:17,635
Gots to have you right now.

1
01:11:17,718 --> 01:11:20,262
- Got to have you right now, girl!
- Nasty fool!

1
01:11:31,982 --> 01:11:35,069
Oh, shit. That nigga dead!
He dead!

1
01:11:37,363 --> 01:11:38,822
Get your ass off me!

1
01:11:38,906 --> 01:11:41,659
He's dead! This nigga's dead!

1
01:11:41,742 --> 01:11:42,868
This nigga's dead!

1
01:11:46,789 --> 01:11:48,165
The captain is dead!

1
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,668
Pork chop grease.

1
01:11:52,044 --> 01:11:55,130
I'll take care of it.
The captain's dead!

1
01:11:58,384 --> 01:12:00,594
That's our motto: We fly, we party, we land.

1
01:12:00,678 --> 01:12:02,304
That's what we tryin'
to do, man.

1
01:12:02,388 --> 01:12:04,139
Nashawn, we gotta talk.

1
01:12:04,181 --> 01:12:05,849
I want to talk to you, too.

1
01:12:06,976 --> 01:12:08,143
The captain is dead.

1
01:12:08,185 --> 01:12:09,728
Dead?

1
01:12:10,813 --> 01:12:13,107
Wait a minute.
Are we talkin' Tupac dead.

1
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:15,109
Like maybe he is
or maybe he isn't,

1
01:12:15,192 --> 01:12:17,861
or Wilt Chamberlain dead, like
he ain't checkin' back in the game?

1
01:12:17,945 --> 01:12:19,530
Dead like he can't
fly this plane, dead.

1
01:12:21,156 --> 01:12:22,533
People are freakin' out.

1
01:12:25,703 --> 01:12:28,706
It's Muggsy
hirin' these prison pilots.

1
01:12:28,747 --> 01:12:30,916
You know what.
That's what we got a copilot for.

1
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:33,460
All we gotta do is find Gaeman,
because I hired him.

1
01:12:33,544 --> 01:12:35,504
He's a professional,
and we should be cool.

1
01:12:35,629 --> 01:12:39,592
Yes, counterclockwise.
Move your ass, baby.

1
01:12:39,675 --> 01:12:42,136
Don't forget to squeeze
my nipple like a cow.

1
01:12:43,387 --> 01:12:47,016
Would you like to see
my African walking stick?

1
01:12:47,057 --> 01:12:48,809
Hey, hey, Gaeman.

1
01:12:48,893 --> 01:12:52,521
Oh, my God. Move over!
How are you, sir?

1
01:12:52,563 --> 01:12:57,401
I was taking a bath, I was dirty.
You are clean now, ladies.

1
01:12:57,484 --> 01:13:00,696
I got an emergency,
I need you to fly the plane.

1
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:02,406
The plane?

1
01:13:02,531 --> 01:13:03,490
Yeah.

1
01:13:03,616 --> 01:13:05,910
- Me? Fly the plane?
- Yes.

1
01:13:05,993 --> 01:13:07,912
Oh, my God!
I get to fly.

1
01:13:07,953 --> 01:13:08,913
They will have a parade!

1
01:13:09,038 --> 01:13:11,457
Go, Gaeman!
Move out the way!

1
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:14,543
Move, you bitches!
I have to fly the plane.

1
01:13:14,585 --> 01:13:16,212
What's wrong with you?

1
01:13:18,005 --> 01:13:19,089
Oh, shit!

1
01:13:20,549 --> 01:13:22,009
He fell hard.

1
01:13:22,092 --> 01:13:23,802
Gaeman!

1
01:13:28,641 --> 01:13:30,100
God damn!

1
01:13:31,018 --> 01:13:33,562
What the hell am I
supposed to do now?

1
01:13:33,687 --> 01:13:37,149
You're gonna find some way
to land this plane.

1
01:13:37,274 --> 01:13:39,276
Meet me in the cockpit, okay?

1
01:13:42,112 --> 01:13:44,448
- Meet you?
- In the cockpit.

1
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,586
I got one more left.

1
01:14:01,298 --> 01:14:04,009
Here you go. You gotta pull
one of these damn cords.

1
01:14:04,134 --> 01:14:05,719
I don't want this shit, man.

1
01:14:05,803 --> 01:14:07,471
I'm responsible
for these people.

1
01:14:07,596 --> 01:14:09,014
I gotta try something.

1
01:14:09,098 --> 01:14:10,933
Fuck them.
What are you, sick?

1
01:14:11,016 --> 01:14:14,270
I know you, all right?
You can't even ride a bike.

1
01:14:14,353 --> 01:14:15,813
How do you expect
to land this thing?

1
01:14:15,938 --> 01:14:17,231
It don't even...

1
01:14:18,983 --> 01:14:20,317
It don't even matter.

1
01:14:20,401 --> 01:14:21,944
I'm not runnin' out
like I always do.

1
01:14:22,027 --> 01:14:24,488
I'm gonna face this shit.
If you wanna go, go.

1
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:28,450
If you goin', go.
You gotta pull this one.

1
01:14:28,534 --> 01:14:30,786
Hey, don't be grabbin' my cord.

1
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:33,789
You gonna make my chute
ejaculate prematurely,

1
01:14:38,419 --> 01:14:40,921
Baby, watch your head.
Don't let that touch you.

1
01:14:41,005 --> 01:14:45,384
- I got a dead pilot, man.
- Just go. God damn!

1
01:14:45,467 --> 01:14:48,304
Oh, my God!
Not like this.

1
01:14:52,683 --> 01:14:56,103
Listen, Giselle...
in case something happens,

1
01:14:56,186 --> 01:14:57,938
there's something I need
to get off my chest.

1
01:14:58,022 --> 01:15:00,065
That night
when you and I broke up.

1
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:01,692
I was on your porch.

1
01:15:01,817 --> 01:15:06,071
I overheard you and your father
arguing about college.

1
01:15:06,113 --> 01:15:08,866
What do you mean,
you're not goin' away to college?

1
01:15:08,949 --> 01:15:11,619
It's too far, I want to stay here
where Nashawn is.

1
01:15:11,702 --> 01:15:15,164
You gotta go, I been waitin'
18 years for this day

1
01:15:15,289 --> 01:15:16,624
to have the house to myself.

1
01:15:16,707 --> 01:15:18,918
I'm not going.

1
01:15:19,001 --> 01:15:22,463
You always dreamed
of going to NYU.

1
01:15:23,547 --> 01:15:25,925
Now they're offering you
a full scholarship.

1
01:15:26,008 --> 01:15:27,551
You tellin' me you're not goin'

1
01:15:27,635 --> 01:15:30,054
because of some little
poop butt ass nigga

1
01:15:30,137 --> 01:15:31,555
who can't even keep a job!

1
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:35,142
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I can't leave Nashawn.

1
01:15:35,226 --> 01:15:37,353
I love him and he loves me.

1
01:15:37,436 --> 01:15:40,397
You are going to college.
You're not messin' up my plans.

1
01:15:40,481 --> 01:15:43,567
<i>I didn't want you to throw
all that away because of me.</i>

1
01:15:43,651 --> 01:15:45,653
I can get $200 a month
for that room.

1
01:15:45,736 --> 01:15:48,197
<i>I just want you to know
that I'm sorry, Giselle.</i>

1
01:15:48,322 --> 01:15:51,033
- <i>Hey, baby.
- I'm so sorry for hurting you.</i>

1
01:15:51,992 --> 01:15:54,453
Leaving you was the biggest
mistake of my life.

1
01:15:56,121 --> 01:15:57,206
For what it's worth...

1
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:02,336
I never stopped loving you.

1
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,556
You better get in there.
You got a plane to land.

1
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:18,477
Yeah.

1
01:16:23,607 --> 01:16:27,528
Cool. I'm cool. I got it.
I got it right now.

1
01:16:29,863 --> 01:16:31,073
Mayday.

1
01:16:34,743 --> 01:16:36,495
SOS.

1
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:38,497
I said SOS.

1
01:16:44,378 --> 01:16:45,462
Come down, selecta.

1
01:16:45,546 --> 01:16:46,630
- Nashawn!
- What?

1
01:16:46,714 --> 01:16:48,549
Are you gonna cut a demo
or radio in?

1
01:16:48,632 --> 01:16:50,092
I don't know what to say.

1
01:16:50,175 --> 01:16:53,429
I got something.
Hello? This is Nashawn Wade,

1
01:16:53,554 --> 01:16:55,681
owner of NWA Airlines.

1
01:16:56,724 --> 01:16:58,392
Yes, sir, the black one.

1
01:16:58,475 --> 01:17:00,269
No, don't hang up. Hello?

1
01:17:00,311 --> 01:17:02,646
Can you please help us?
We got a situation here.

1
01:17:02,771 --> 01:17:06,483
My pilot died, and I got people
on the back of my plane

1
01:17:06,525 --> 01:17:09,111
asking for help and... hello?

1
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:14,950
They put me on hold.

1
01:17:14,992 --> 01:17:19,121
<i>Due to the high number of calls,
your estimated wait time</i>

1
01:17:19,205 --> 01:17:21,290
- <i>is 45 minutes.
- What are you doing here?</i>

1
01:17:21,332 --> 01:17:22,666
We family, man.

1
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:25,794
We was in this from the beginning,
we gonna ride this out to the end.

1
01:17:25,878 --> 01:17:27,296
That's my nigga, man.

1
01:17:29,173 --> 01:17:32,259
Look at my watch.
What's up, G?

1
01:17:32,343 --> 01:17:35,346
Excuse me. I represent three
of the four white people on board.

1
01:17:35,429 --> 01:17:38,265
I want to tell you fellas
we are behind you 100%.

1
01:17:39,391 --> 01:17:40,976
What? Hunkee, please.

1
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:43,187
I'm just here to find
the little black box

1
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:45,522
so I can wrap
my big, black ass around it.

1
01:17:45,606 --> 01:17:48,609
If I have to ride that tiny,
indestructible motherfucker

1
01:17:48,692 --> 01:17:50,236
30,000 feet to safety,

1
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:53,239
trust you'll hear bitch screamin'.
"Hi ho, Silver".

1
01:17:53,322 --> 01:17:54,949
Where's the box?

1
01:17:55,032 --> 01:17:58,035
I really want to thank y'all
for giving me all this confidence.

1
01:17:58,118 --> 01:18:01,038
- I really feel it, I do.
- You're welcome.

1
01:18:01,121 --> 01:18:02,831
Somebody knows
how to land this plane,

1
01:18:02,915 --> 01:18:04,333
this would be
the time to speak.

1
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:06,627
I saw a show on
the Discovery channel,

1
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:08,420
but that was about motorcycles.

1
01:18:18,639 --> 01:18:20,182
Take control of the plane.

1
01:18:20,224 --> 01:18:21,225
What?

1
01:18:21,308 --> 01:18:24,103
You have to disengage
the autopilot.

1
01:18:24,186 --> 01:18:25,229
How do you know that?

1
01:18:25,312 --> 01:18:27,606
I used to date this pilot,

1
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:30,568
and we would make love
in the cockpit.

1
01:18:30,609 --> 01:18:35,614
You haven't had an orgasm
until you've had it during descent.

1
01:18:35,739 --> 01:18:38,576
Bitch, can you land this plane?

1
01:18:38,659 --> 01:18:41,203
Show me where it is, Blanca.
What is it?

1
01:18:42,329 --> 01:18:44,123
I don't remember.

1
01:18:44,206 --> 01:18:45,374
That's what I told you...

1
01:18:45,457 --> 01:18:46,750
I need you to go
to the back then.

1
01:18:46,834 --> 01:18:48,043
No, hold on.

1
01:18:48,127 --> 01:18:50,212
Last time I was here...

1
01:18:58,596 --> 01:18:59,972
Here, here!

1
01:19:00,055 --> 01:19:01,015
There it is. Push it.

1
01:19:01,098 --> 01:19:02,057
Somebody help her.

1
01:19:02,141 --> 01:19:03,726
Okay, I gotta grab it.

1
01:19:06,061 --> 01:19:07,938
Guess I had a little control
right away.

1
01:19:08,063 --> 01:19:09,857
I'm flyin', y'all.

1
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:12,943
Okay, what's next, Blanca?

1
01:19:13,027 --> 01:19:14,320
I would...

1
01:19:17,698 --> 01:19:18,908
Yes, the flaps!

1
01:19:18,991 --> 01:19:20,576
The flaps!
Adjusting the flaps.

1
01:19:20,659 --> 01:19:22,119
What's next?

1
01:19:22,203 --> 01:19:24,872
I think it was... the trim.

1
01:19:27,124 --> 01:19:28,792
I cannot hear her.

1
01:19:28,876 --> 01:19:31,295
I got it.
I see what you're sayin'.

1
01:19:31,337 --> 01:19:32,421
What's next?

1
01:19:32,463 --> 01:19:35,507
I don't know. This is where
he usually pops the cork.

1
01:19:36,383 --> 01:19:38,302
We are so fucked!

1
01:19:38,344 --> 01:19:40,262
Don't panic, please.
You're gonna be okay.

1
01:19:40,346 --> 01:19:42,640
You can't use that phone
while we're on the plane.

1
01:19:42,765 --> 01:19:44,433
Girl, please, they say that
to rip you off.

1
01:19:44,558 --> 01:19:46,018
They want you to use
their phone.

1
01:19:46,143 --> 01:19:48,062
- I am calling for some help.
- No, I'm telling you.

1
01:19:48,145 --> 01:19:49,813
Don't be hardheaded.
Don't use that phone.

1
01:19:49,897 --> 01:19:51,607
Fuck that!

1
01:20:15,089 --> 01:20:18,008
Okay. All right.
We back on track right now.

1
01:20:18,092 --> 01:20:19,552
What next, Blanca?

1
01:20:19,677 --> 01:20:21,303
The wheels.

1
01:20:22,513 --> 01:20:23,681
Muggsy, pull the wheels down.

1
01:20:23,764 --> 01:20:25,182
Grab the wheel
and do it slow.

1
01:20:26,308 --> 01:20:27,768
I feel it comin' down, y'all,

1
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:31,063
Oh, yes!

1
01:20:31,146 --> 01:20:35,568
Oh, D.J., this is it!
It's gonna happen this time, baby.

1
01:20:35,651 --> 01:20:38,821
We about to die,
you got me tied up down here.

1
01:20:38,862 --> 01:20:40,614
Damn it, I don't give a fuck.

1
01:20:40,698 --> 01:20:43,659
We goin' to heaven
with one last nut.

1
01:20:43,701 --> 01:20:45,035
Nigga, stay focused!

1
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:47,121
Yeah! I'm doin' it!

1
01:20:55,045 --> 01:20:59,967
I told you it was the turbulence.
You don't want none of this.

1
01:21:06,932 --> 01:21:07,975
Here we go.

1
01:21:08,058 --> 01:21:09,768
We gonna land.

1
01:21:22,698 --> 01:21:24,909
New York, here we go!
This is it right here.

1
01:21:25,034 --> 01:21:26,327
That's the ground!

1
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:48,849
We made it.
We gonna live.

1
01:21:48,933 --> 01:21:50,976
I did it. We down.

1
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:56,315
You did it!
That's just what you do, cousin.

1
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:57,441
Exactly what I do!

1
01:21:57,566 --> 01:22:00,736
You see what I'm sayin'?
I was so scared.

1
01:22:00,778 --> 01:22:02,655
You crazy bitch!
Fuck this airline!

1
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:06,492
You know what, she was
on the way out anyway.

1
01:22:06,534 --> 01:22:09,870
- Forget her, baby. You did it.
- I did.

1
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:15,751
Yeah, I can do that.

1
01:22:17,002 --> 01:22:18,963
All right, y'all
with the mushy stuff.

1
01:22:19,046 --> 01:22:21,006
I'm a go check on
the passengers.

1
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:23,259
- Y'all just too cute.
- My boy.

1
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:28,931
Maybe we should go, too.
We should check on 'em, too.

1
01:22:29,014 --> 01:22:30,474
All right. Come on.

1
01:22:31,642 --> 01:22:33,769
What a day.

1
01:22:35,479 --> 01:22:38,857
Wait a minute.
Hold that, sugar dumplin'.

1
01:22:40,484 --> 01:22:42,069
I don't know
what smells better...

1
01:22:42,152 --> 01:22:45,531
The New York air
or your magnificent perfume.

1
01:22:45,614 --> 01:22:48,617
Why, thank you.
That's very kind of you.

1
01:22:50,119 --> 01:22:51,579
Wait a minute.

1
01:22:55,082 --> 01:22:56,709
That's an Adam's apple.

1
01:22:56,792 --> 01:22:59,753
I'm a player, but I don't play
that way. Floor Walker!

1
01:22:59,837 --> 01:23:01,046
No, I...

1
01:23:01,171 --> 01:23:03,090
- Hey, Muggs.
- Yo, cousin.

1
01:23:03,173 --> 01:23:04,842
That's what I'm talkin' about.
We made it!

1
01:23:04,967 --> 01:23:08,262
What kind of shit...
This is Central Park.

1
01:23:08,345 --> 01:23:11,015
Where is Central Park?
It's in New York, ain't it?

1
01:23:11,098 --> 01:23:12,892
You got JFK, LaGuardia,
Newark...

1
01:23:12,975 --> 01:23:15,102
What you need an airport for,
you got all this grass?

1
01:23:15,185 --> 01:23:19,565
Ain't this a bitch?
This nigga is pissin' on the plane!

1
01:23:19,648 --> 01:23:22,610
That's your problem.
You always thinkin' on the nega...

1
01:23:24,194 --> 01:23:28,449
Hell, no, I know they didn't
just steal my damn rims.

1
01:23:28,532 --> 01:23:30,784
That's what your punk ass get.

1
01:23:30,868 --> 01:23:32,912
You know how hard it is
to get 84-inch rims?

1
01:23:33,037 --> 01:23:35,497
That's a big-ass tire
for a little-ass plane

1
01:23:35,581 --> 01:23:36,665
and a short-ass nigga.

1
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:39,043
Why don't you go put
a doughnut in your mouth?

1
01:23:39,126 --> 01:23:41,337
I am going to sue your ass,
I am gonna sue the airline...

1
01:23:41,378 --> 01:23:43,380
That's all you do is complain.

1
01:23:43,464 --> 01:23:46,550
It doesn't matter, I'm not
gonna let you spoil this for me.

1
01:23:46,634 --> 01:23:49,136
I tell you what,
Muggs, take everybody upstairs.

1
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:50,846
Drinks on me.
Let's party!

1
01:23:52,389 --> 01:23:54,266
<i>And we did party.</i>

1
01:23:54,350 --> 01:23:57,853
<i>Just like I told y'all...
We fly, we party and we land.</i>

1
01:24:38,018 --> 01:24:40,229
Pop, where'd you get
the moves from?

1
01:24:40,312 --> 01:24:41,939
Where do ya think
you got 'em from, son?

1
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:03,711
Wow! This is the bomb!

1
01:25:07,214 --> 01:25:11,135
What? What did I say?
Let's dance!

1
01:25:11,235 --> 01:25:16,235
